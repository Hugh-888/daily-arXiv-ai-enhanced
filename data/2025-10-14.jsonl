Movies and additional visualizations available at\n  https://tinyurl.com/shapiromovies", "summary": "The gravitational wave signal produced by the merger of two compact objects\nincludes both an oscillatory transient and a non-oscillatory part, the\nso-called memory effect. This produces a permanent displacement of test masses\nand has not yet been measured. We use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations, including neutrinos, with several representative viable equations\nof state, to quantify--for the first time--the effects of the neutron star\nmagnetic field, neutrino emission, and the ejected mass on the linear and\nnonlinear displacement memory in binary neutron star mergers. We find that the\nadditional contributions due to the emission of electromagnetic radiation,\nneutrinos and baryonic ejecta can be ~15% of the total memory for moderate\nmagnetic fields and up to ~50% for extreme magnetic fields. The memory is most\naffected by changes in the equation of state, the binary mass, and the magnetic\nfield. In particular, for moderate premerger field strengths, the dominant\nimpact of the electromagnetic field is the change in the gravitational wave\nluminosity, and the associated gravitational wave null memory, due to the\nunstable growth of the magnetic field and the resulting redistribution of\nangular momentum it induces in the remnant. While the direct electromagnetic\ncontribution to the null memory is additive, the change in the gravitational\nwave null memory can--in some cases--result in the total memory being smaller\nthan that from the corresponding nonmagnetized binary. Furthermore, in contrast\nto binary black hole mergers, the growth of the memory in binary neutron star\nmergers is extended due to the long emission timescale of electromagnetic\nfields, neutrinos, and ejecta. These results necessitate the consideration of\nthe magnetic field, as well as the equation of state, for accurate parameter\nestimation in future analyses of gravitational wave memory data."}

However, its high melting\npoint and inherent brittleness pose significant challenges for processing $W$\nusing additive manufacturing (AM). Cold spray (CS), a solid-state AM process\nthat relies on high-velocity particle impact and plastic deformation, offers a\npromising alternative. In this study, we employ atomistic simulations to\ninvestigate the feasibility of CS for tungsten. We show that ultrasound\nperturbation can significantly enhance the self-diffusivity and plastic\ndeformation of $W$ compared to the negligible diffusion and plastic deformation\nobserved in non-ultrasound-assisted CS of $W$. For different impact velocities,\nparticle sizes, and ultrasound parameters, we demonstrate that\nultrasound-assisted viscoplasticity enhances self-diffusivity by inhibiting\ngrain boundaries and incorporating softening in $W$. Moreover, we found that\nthis enhanced diffusion in ultrasound-assisted $W$ can be exploited to promote\ninterdiffusion at the particle-substrate interface, enabling in situ alloy\nformation. Through the formation of an equimolar $V$-$W$ alloy on a $W$\nsubstrate using ultrasound-assisted CS simulations, we observed distinct\nmechanical properties and a reduced dislocation density in the deposited\ncoating compared to a pure tungsten substrate. These results highlight the\npotential of ultrasound-assisted CS as a viable approach for fabricating\nuniform coatings and engineered alloys, addressing key limitations in the AM of\nrefractory metals."}

We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems\nfrom various fields, each representing distinct scenarios. The effectiveness of\nthe proposed method is evident, as the PINN approach for solving the Burgers$'$\nequation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the\ndiffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after\n12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In\ncontrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease,\ndemonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of\n$10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the\nproposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the\nstandard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are\nunavailable. It generalizes both PINN and Gradient$-$enhanced PINN (gPINN), and\ncan be effectively applied in scenarios prone to low accuracy and convergence\nissues, particularly in the absence of labeled data."}

Available\nthreshold estimates for transversal circuits are empirically obtained and\nlimited to specific, sub-optimal decoders. To establish rigorous bounds on the\nnegative impact of error spreading by the transversal gates, we generalize the\nstatistical mechanical (stat-mech) mapping from quantum memories to logical\ncircuits.

We propose $\\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep\nlearning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature\ninteractions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a\ntemporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record;\nsecond, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from\nfeatures at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the\ntracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how\nany feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and\nthrough its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and\ndisease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic\nkidney disease cohort.

The\nprimary advantage of O4M-SP is its ability to handle various bin dimensions in\na single training process while incorporating support and weight constraints\ncommon in practice. Our training method introduces two innovative mechanisms.\nFirst, it employs a weighted reward function that integrates loading rate and a\nnew height difference metric for packing layouts, promoting improved bin\nutilization through flatter packing configurations. Second, it combines clipped\npolicy gradient optimization with a tailored policy drifting method to mitigate\npolicy entropy collapse, encouraging exploration at critical decision nodes\nduring packing to avoid suboptimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat O4M-SP generalizes successfully across diverse bin dimensions and\nsignificantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, O4M-SP exhibits strong\npractical applicability by effectively addressing packing scenarios with\nstability constraints."}

Recent work has introduced\nmulti-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a\nsingle model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility,\nquantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency\nimproves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and\nactivates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present\nAnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded\nQuantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations.

Most existing works adopt a simplified approach\n- using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for\nheterophilic graphs.

This finding challenges conventional fixed\nfilter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve\nexpressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a\nheterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily\ndegree of G affect the performance of GNNs?

While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they\nencode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context\nexamples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such\nmethods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as\ninitializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they\nincorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes\namortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on\nwhether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled.\nBuilding on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most\nmethods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process\ntask data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address\nthis, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine\nsolutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic\noptimization.

With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and\nindividual regrets can be bounded by $O(\\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of\nactions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality\nof the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this\nend, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the\nstrongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known,\nboth the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\\sqrt{\\log m\n\\log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an\noptimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of\ncertain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We\nthen show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and\nindividual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge\nby providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly,\nthese social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant\nfactor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the\nlast-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic\nbased on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent\ndynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds."}

While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning\ncapabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and\nlong rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4\nquantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL\nwhile reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that\nquantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and\nenabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize\nexploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,\nwhich dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that\nQeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is\nthe first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB\nGPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster\nreward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while\nmatching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical\nbenchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These\nresults establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training\nin LLMs."}

In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial\nvulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.\nSpecifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more\nfeatures than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent\nrepresentations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial\nperturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack\npatterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a\nmechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack\ntransferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific\nvulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled\nsuperposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial\nvulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained\non CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct\nof networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning\nprocess or non-robust inputs."}

We state\na connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential\nsamplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein\nlearnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist\nfunctions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training\nprocedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt\nsampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target\ndistribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and\ntwist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training\nsignal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience\nreplay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine\nhistorical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay\nbuffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete\nspaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we\ndemonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as\ntraining stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods."}

Leveraging recent advances in deep learning, neural network-based\ndecoders have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the reliability of\nQEC. We propose the Hierarchical Qubit-Merging Transformer (HQMT), a novel and\ngeneral decoding framework that explicitly leverages the structural graph of\nstabilizer codes to learn error correlations across multiple scales. Our\narchitecture first computes attention locally on structurally related groups of\nstabilizers and then systematically merges these qubit-centric representations\nto build a global view of the error syndrome. The proposed HQMT achieves\nsubstantially lower logical error rates for surface codes by integrating a\ndedicated qubit-merging layer within the transformer architecture. Across\nvarious code distances, HQMT significantly outperforms previous neural\nnetwork-based QEC decoders as well as a powerful belief propagation with\nordered statistics decoding (BP+OSD) baseline. This hierarchical approach\nprovides a scalable and effective framework for surface code decoding,\nadvancing the realization of reliable quantum computing."}
