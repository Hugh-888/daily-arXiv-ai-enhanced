Submitted to General Relativity and Gravitation", "summary": "I construct an Einstein-Cartan ekpyrotic model (ECEM): a homogeneous, nearly Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background in Einstein-Cartan (EC) gravity whose spin-torsion sector, modeled phenomenologically as a Weyssenhoff fluid with stiff scaling $\\propto a^{-6}$, is coupled to a scalar field with a steep exponential potential that interpolates between a negative ekpyrotic branch and a positive plateau. Extending the Copeland-Liddle-Wands (CLW) scalar-fluid dynamical system to a six-dimensional phase space including shear, curvature, and spin-torsion, I recast the equations in a compact deceleration-parameter form, compute the full Jacobian, and evaluate maximal Lyapunov exponents. Numerical solutions show that the ekpyrotic branch ($w_φ\\gg1$) exponentially damps homogeneous shear, while the softened branch ($w_φ<1$) allows $ρ_s$ to overtake the scalar during contraction and trigger a torsion-supported bounce at high but finite densities where the EC spin-torsion term becomes dynamically dominant. Scans in a two-parameter softening plane $(φ_{\\rm b},Δ)$ identify a finite region of nonsingular trajectories and quantify the required tuning; in the parameter ranges explored the maximal Lyapunov exponent on the constrained phase space is negative, giving no indication of chaotic behavior in this homogeneous truncation even when the usual curvature mode that destabilizes contracting General Relativity (GR) backgrounds is included. The construction is purely phenomenological and confined to homogeneous backgrounds: it does not address entropy accumulation, the cosmological arrow of time, or a complete cyclic cosmology."}

In this paper, we study the periodic orbits and their corresponding gravitational wave emissions within the framework of an effective field theory-based extension of general relativity (EFTGR), which incorporates higher-order curvature terms into the Einstein-Hilbert action. We start with a brief analysis of the modified black hole spacetime in EFTGR and examine how its parameters influence the dynamics of a massive neutral particle using the Lagrangian formalism. Focusing on the impact of the higher-order curvature terms in EFTGR, we examine the properties of periodic orbits, which are characterized by three topological integers $(z, w, v)$ that uniquely classify their trajectories. By analyzing these orbits within EFTGR, we aim to provide new insights into how strong-field deviations from general relativity may manifest in observable phenomena. We then calculate the gravitational waveforms generated by these periodic orbits, identifying potential observational signatures. Our analysis reveals a direct connection between the zoom-whirl orbital behavior of the small compact object and the gravitational waveforms it emits: higher zoom numbers lead to increasingly intricate waveform substructures. The results contribute to a clearer understanding of the dynamical features of EFTGR and open new avenues for probing black hole properties via gravitational wave detection."}

The differential equations to determine the subleading correction of the structure variables are presented. The system retains the current $j^μ$ accounting for the steady flow, which contributes to the entropy current $s^μ$ in such a general covariant form that $s^μ=au^μ+ bj^μ$ with $a, b$ unknown parametric functions. To determine them, a new condition is proposed. This condition imposes the entropy current to be of an unconventional form $s^μ=(s-bj^0)u^μ/u^0+ bj^μ$, where $s$ is the entropy density.

While steady-state resonances are assumed in the search of gravitational wave echos, realistic barriers are expected to possess intrinsically low reflectivity. In this work, we investigate this low-finesse limit via time-domain simulations and demonstrate that early-time echoes behave as transient scattered wave packets rather than cavity eigenstates. A central finding is the identification of spectral drift, where the central frequency progressively redshifts. This evolution occurs because high-frequency components dissipate significantly faster than the fundamental mode due to the filtering effect of the potential barrier. To distinguish transient interference from genuine resonance, we establish a physical criterion based on cavity lifetime, identifying a critical reflectivity threshold of approximately $0.37$. Since theoretical models typically operate deep within the overdamped regime below this limit, the resulting signals are spectrally non-stationary. We propose that detection strategies should shift towards dynamic time-frequency tracking to capture these drifting signatures."}

We introduce value profiles: a small set of reusable bundles of value-related parameters (outcome preferences, policy priors, and policy precision) assigned to hidden states in a generative model. As posterior beliefs over states evolve trial by trial, effective control parameters arise via belief-weighted mixing, enabling state-conditional strategy recruitment without requiring independent parameters for each context. We evaluate this framework in probabilistic reversal learning, comparing static-precision, entropy-coupled dynamic-precision, and profile-based models using cross-validated log-likelihood and information criteria. Model comparison favors the profile-based model over simpler alternatives (about 100-point AIC differences), and parameter-recovery analyses support structural identifiability even when context must be inferred from noisy observations. Model-based inference further suggests that adaptive control in this task is driven primarily by modulation of policy priors rather than policy precision, with gradual belief-dependent profile recruitment consistent with state-conditional (not purely uncertainty-driven) control. Overall, reusable value profiles provide a tractable computational account of belief-conditioned value control in volatile environments and yield testable signatures of belief-dependent control and behavioral flexibility."}

In this work, we propose a novel multi-resolution Hybrid Wavelet-Fourier-Enhanced Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (HWF-PIKAN) for solving advection problems based on collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) with both continuous and discontinuous initial conditions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct systematic benchmarks on classical advection equations in one and two dimensions. These tests demonstrate the model's ability to accurately capture smooth and abrupt features. We then extend the application of HWF-PIKAN to the high-dimensional phase-space setting by solving the CBE in a continuous-velocity manner. This leverages the Hamiltonian concept of phase-space dynamics to model the statistical behavior of particles in a collisionless system, where advection governs the evolution of a probability distribution function or number density. Comparative analysis against Vanilla PINN, Vanilla PIKAN, as well as Fourier-enhanced and Wavelet-enhanced PIKAN variants, shows that the proposed hybrid model significantly improves solution accuracy and convergence speed.

The gravitational redshift analysis separates contributions from mass, cosmological constant, electromagnetic charge, and Born-Infeld (BI) corrections, with the latter scaling as $a^4/r^6$ and thus confined to near-horizon regimes. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate light deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, demonstrating how dispersive media can either enhance or suppress nonlinear electrodynamic signatures depending on observational configurations. The thermodynamic analysis in extended phase space, where the BH mass corresponds to enthalpy, reveals phase structures with heat capacity transitions between positive and negative values, indicating regions of local stability and instability sensitive to parameter choices. We study BH heat engines operating in rectangular thermodynamic cycles, achieving efficiencies of $η\\sim 0.11$--$0.21$ that reach 30--61\\% of the corresponding Carnot limits, consistent with other AdS BH systems.

However, their theoretical derivation and practical implementation are often closely coupled, which obscures the design space. To address this, we propose a common design framework for representative shortcut models. This framework provides theoretical justification for their validity and disentangles concrete component-level choices, thereby enabling systematic identification of improvements. With our proposed improvements, the resulting one-step model achieves a new state-of-the-art FID50k of 2.85 on ImageNet-256x256 under the classifier-free guidance setting. Remarkably, the model requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning.

We bring this idea back to one dimension by introducing a holographic isoTNS ansatz: a (1+1)-dimensional lattice of isometric tensors where the horizontal axis encodes physical space and an auxiliary \"holographic\" axis boosts expressivity. Despite the enlarged geometry, contractions and local updates remain computationally efficient due to isometric constraints. We investigate this ansatz and benchmark it in comparison to matrix product states (MPS). First, we show that randomly initialized holographic isoTNS typically display volume-law entanglement even at modest bond dimension, surpassing the representational limits of MPS and related ansätze. Second, through analytic constructions and variational optimization, we demonstrate that holographic isoTNS can faithfully represent arbitrary fermionic Gaussian states, Clifford states, and certain short-time-evolved states under local evolution -- a family of states that is highly entangled but low in complexity. Third, to exploit this expressivity in broad situations, we implement a time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on holographic isoTNS. While the method remains efficient and scalable, error accumulation over TEBD sweeps suppresses entanglement and leads to rapid deviations from exact dynamics. Overall, holographic isoTNS broaden the reach of tensor-network methods, opening new avenues to study physics in the volume-law regime."}

To address these limitations, we propose a neural network architecture, constructed using singular value decomposition technique, together with a strictly semi-orthogonality-constrained training algorithm, to enhance the performance of traditional contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method matches the performance of traditional contrastive learning techniques in identifying critical transitions, yet is considerably more lightweight and markedly more resistant to noise."}

Here we introduce a generalized canonical form for uniform MPS with a boundary matrix, thus extending the analytical MPS framework to a more general setting of wider physical significance. This canonical form reveals that any such MPS can be represented as a block-invertible matrix product operator acting on a structured class of algebraic regular language states that capture its essential long-range and scale-invariant features. Our construction builds on new algebraic results of independent interest that characterize the span and algebra generated by non-semisimple sets of matrices, including a generalized quantum Wielandt's inequality that gives an explicit upper bound on the blocking length at which the fixed-length span stabilizes to an algebra. Together, these results establish a unified theoretical foundation for uniform MPS with boundaries, bridging the gap between periodic and arbitrary-boundary settings, and providing the basis for extending key analytical and classification results of matrix product states to a much broader class of states and operators."}

In this work, we propose an effective hybrid approach that combines physics-based modeling with data-driven learning to enhance state estimation and further prediction. Our method builds upon the Parameterized Background Data-Weak (PBDW) framework, which naturally integrates a reduced-order representation of the best-available model with measurement data to account for both anticipated and unanticipated uncertainties. To address model discrepancies not captured by the reduced-order space, and learn the structure of model deviation, we incorporate a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) constrained to be an orthogonal complement of the best-knowledge manifold. This ensures that the learned correction targets only the unknown components of model bias, preserving the interpretability and fidelity of the physical model. An optimal sensor placement strategy is also investigated to maximize information gained from measurements. We validate the proposed approach on a representative problem involving the Helmholtz equation under various sources of modeling error, including those arising from boundary conditions and source terms."}

Such light-matter interactions are often studied with a broad variety of analytical and computational methods that are constrained by approximation techniques or by computational scaling. Quantum processors present a new avenue to address these challenges. We consider the case of cavity mediated two-qubit gates. To investigate quantum state transfer between the qubits, we implement simulations with quantum circuits that are able to reliably track the dynamics of the system. Our quantum algorithm, compatible with NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) era systems, allows us to map out the fidelity of the state transfer operation between qubits as a function of a broad range of system parameters including the respective detunings between the qubits and the cavity, the damping factor of the cavity, and the respective couplings between the qubits and the cavity. The algorithm provides a robust and intuitive solution, alongside a satisfactory agreement with analytical solutions or classical simulation algorithms in their respective regimes of validity. It allows us to identify under-explored regimes of optimal performance, relevant for heterogeneous quantum platforms, where the two-qubit gate can be rather effective between far-detuned qubits that are neither resonant with each other nor with the cavity. Besides its present application, the method introduced in the current paper can be efficiently used in otherwise untractable variations of the model and in various efforts to simulate and optimize photon-mediated two-qubit gates and other relevant operations in quantum information processing."}

This paper argues that DPO does not rewrite a models internal beliefs; instead, it acts as a low rank steering mechanism that nudges activations along a small number of preference directions. Using a simple derivation, we show that the DPO gradient depends only on the difference between the logit embeddings of preferred and dispreferred completions, implying a first order shift in the final hidden representation rather than a deep restructuring of semantics. We then extract an empirical steering vector from a DPO tuned model and demonstrate that adding this vector to base activations reproduces most of the aligned behavior, while subtracting it nearly restores the original model. Finally, spectral analyses reveal rank-one dominance and entropy collapse in upper layers, indicating that alignment is funneled through a narrow subspace. Taken together, these results support a behavioral illusion view of DPO: it teaches models how to act aligned, not what to believe."}

This demands an enormous number of execution shots, making practical use prohibitively expensive. We observe that VQA costs can be significantly reduced by exploiting execution similarities across an application's tasks. Based on this insight, we propose TreeVQA, a tree-based execution framework that begins by executing tasks jointly and progressively branches only as their quantum executions diverge. Implemented as a VQA wrapper, TreeVQA integrates with typical VQA applications.

However, the dominant paradigm for network optimization relies on designing specialist policies based on handcrafted rules or deep learning models, leading to poor generalization across diverse tasks and environments. In contrast, large language models (LLMs), pretrained on Internet-scale corpora, provide a rich and unified knowledge base that encodes fundamental networking principles. Combined with their emergent abilities in generalization to unseen scenarios, LLMs offer a transformative foundation for generalist network policies that can generalize across diverse tasks and environments with minimal adaptation. In this paper, we present Trailblazer, the first systematic framework to realize such a generalist policy for networking. Trailblazer incorporates a network alignment scheme to ground the LLM in specific networking tasks, and an adaptive policy collaboration mechanism that offloads simple control cases from the LLM to a lightweight policy for computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations and large-scale real-world online evaluation on Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok), Trailblazer, powered by a single LLM, demonstrates stronger cross-task and cross-environment generalization than conventional specialist policies. Our results validate LLMs as the foundation for generalist network policies, and position Trailblazer as the first step toward the generalist-driven paradigm that enables strong generalization with minimal efforts in policy design."}

For extremal configurations, the near-horizon limit yields a warped $\\mathrm{AdS}_3$ geometry with an associated Maxwell field aligned to the $U(1)$ fibration. Imposing standard Kerr/CFT boundary conditions, the asymptotic symmetry algebra gives rise to a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c_L$ and left-moving temperature $T_L$ that depend explicitly on the external field strength.

The joining hypersurface requires that the shift vector of the warp drive spacetime must satisfy the solution of a particular inviscid Burgers equation, namely, the gauge where the shift vector is not a function of the $y$ and $z$ spacetime coordinates. Such a gauge connects the warp drive metric to shock waves via a Burgers-type equation, which was previously found to be an Einstein equations vacuum solution for the warp drive geometry. It is also shown that not all Ricci and Riemann tensors components are zero at the joining hypersurface, but for that to happen they depend on the shift vector solution of the inviscid Burgers equation at the joining wall. This means that the warp drive geometry is not globally flat."}

Recent advances in patch-based Transformer models have shown strong potential in various time series forecasting tasks. However, most existing methods rely on fixed-size patch embedding, making it difficult to model the complex and heterogeneous patterns of airport passenger flows. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deformable temporal-spectral transformer named DTSFormer that integrates a multiscale deformable partitioning module and a joint temporal-spectral filtering module. Specifically, the input sequence is dynamically partitioned into multiscale temporal patches via a novel window function-based masking, enabling the extraction of heterogeneous trends across different temporal stages. Then, within each scale, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to capture both high- and low-frequency components, thereby emphasizing the volatility and periodicity inherent in airport passenger flows. Finally, the resulting multi-frequency features are subsequently fused in the time domain to jointly model short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on real-world passenger flow data collected at Beijing Capital International Airport from January 2023 to March 2024. The results indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models across different prediction horizons. Further analysis shows that the deformable partitioning module aligns patch lengths with dominant periods and heterogeneous trends, enabling superior capture of sudden high-frequency fluctuations."}

For example, fully symmetry-adapted universal operator pools typically generate long and deep quantum circuits, gate-efficient universal operator pools generally break symmetries, and gate-efficient fully symmetry-adapted operator pools may not be universal. In this work, we analyze such symmetry dilemmas both theoretically and numerically. On the theory side, we prove that the popular, gate-efficient operator pool consisting of singlet spin-adapted singles and perfect-pairing doubles is not universal when spatial symmetry is enforced. To demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the three types of pools, we perform numerical simulations using an adaptive algorithm paired with operator pools that are (i) fully symmetry-adapted and universal, (ii) fully symmetry-adapted and non-universal, and (iii) breaking a single symmetry and are universal. Our numerical simulations encompass three physically relevant scenarios in which the target state is (i) the global ground state, (ii) the ground state crossed by a state differing in multiple symmetry properties, and (iii) the ground state crossed by a state differing in a single symmetry property. Our results show when symmetry-breaking but universal pools can be used safely, when enforcing at least one distinguishing symmetry suffices, and when a particular symmetry must be rigorously preserved to avoid variational collapse. Together, the formal and numerical analysis provides a practical guide for designing and benchmarking symmetry-adapted operator pools that balance universality, resource requirements, and robust state targeting in quantum simulations for chemistry."}

Based on the modified adjacency matrix, we leverage PageRank along with the node label information to construct a projection. The constructed projection effectively maps nodes to values that strongly correlated with model performance when using datasets both with and without intra-type connections, which demonstrates the universal existence of topological bias in HGNNs. To handle this bias, we propose a debiasing structure based on the difference in the mapped values of nodes and use it along with the original graph structure for contrastive learning. Experiments on three public datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving HGNNs' performance and debiasing."}

I argue that the deeper conflict is logical: quantum theory is inherently contextual, whereas the classical tradition presupposes a single global, Boolean valuation. Building on Bohr's complementarity, the Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen argument and Bell's theorem, I recast locality and completeness as the existence of a global section of a presheaf of value assignments over the category of measurement contexts. The absence of global sections expresses the impossibility of context-independent description, and Čech cohomology measures the resulting obstruction. The internal logic of the presheaf topos is intuitionistic, and the seven-valued contextual logic proposed by Ghose and Patra is exhibited as a finite Heyting algebra capturing patterns of truth, falsity and indeterminacy across incompatible contexts. Classical physics corresponds to the sheaf case, where compatible local data glue and Boolean logic is effectively restored. Measurement is therefore reinterpreted as sheafification of presheaf-valued truth rather than as a physical breakdown of unitarity. Finally, a $σ$--$λ$ dynamics motivated by stochastic mechanics provides a continuous interpolation between strongly contextual and approximately classical regimes, dissolving the usual measurement paradoxes and apparent nonlocality as artefacts of an illegitimate demand for global truth."}

The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning."}

Their transverse spatial correlations are usually analyzed within the thin-crystal approximation, where the two-photon wavefunction is assumed to factorize into independent functions of the sum and difference coordinates. In practice, however, birefringence-induced transverse walk-off breaks this factorization and couples these degrees of freedom. Here, we show that this coupling persists even for nominally thin crystals once the free-space propagation of the joint spatial intensity is taken into account. This sum-difference coordinate coupling leads to a distinctive tapering of the transverse correlations near the crystal image plane-an effect that standard factorized models cannot capture. Numerical simulations and experimental data clearly confirm this novel behavior. Our findings provide a more complete description of photon-pair generation in birefringent nonlinear media and clarify fundamental limits on spatially resolved quantum imaging and spatial-mode quantum information processing with EPR states."}

Specifically, starting with the surface term, we extract a symmetric rank-two tensor together with an anti-symmetric one out of this term with the variation operator replaced with the Lie derivative along an arbitrary vector field. By utilizing an equality stemming from the Lie derivative of the Lagrangian density along an arbitrary vector field, it is proved that the resulting symmetric rank-two tensor is identified with the functional derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric. Such a result further brings forth the expression for the field equations constructed from the symmetric rank-two tensor, which naturally rules out the derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric and coincides with the one for the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion. Furthermore, it is illustrated that the construction of the expression for the field equations from the symmetric rank-two tensor must be feasible as long as the variation operator in the variation equation of the Lagrangian is allowed to be substituted by the Lie derivative along an arbitrary vector field. On the other hand, as a byproduct, the anti-symmetric rank-two tensor turns out to be the Noether charge two-form. Our results offer a straightforward support on the proposal in our previous work that the surface term gives a unified description for field equations and Noether charges in the context of theories of gravity admitting diffeomorphism invariance symmetry."}

This study leverages the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to automate actuator settings for optimal greenhouse management. To enhance interpretability and trust in the model decision-making process, both local and global explanation techniques were employed using model-inherent interpretation, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and SHapley additive explanations (SHAP). These explainability methods provide information on how different sensor readings, such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, light, and outer climate, contribute to actuator control decisions in an automated greenhouse. The trained TFT model achieved a test accuracy of 95% on a class-imbalanced dataset for actuator control settings in an automated greenhouse environment. The results demonstrate the varying influence of each sensor on real-time greenhouse adjustments, ensuring transparency and enabling adaptive fine-tuning for improved crop yield and resource efficiency."}

This paper introduces a novel system for real-time feedback on near-failure states (RiR $\\le$ 2) during resistance exercise using only a single wrist-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). We propose a two-stage pipeline suitable for edge deployment: first, a ResNet-based model segments repetitions from the 6-axis IMU data in real-time. Second, features derived from this segmentation, alongside direct convolutional features and historical context captured by an LSTM, are used by a classification model to identify exercise windows corresponding to near-failure states. Using a newly collected dataset from 13 diverse participants performing preacher curls to failure (631 total reps), our segmentation model achieved an F1 score of 0.83, and the near-failure classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.82 under simulated real-time evaluation conditions (1.6 Hz inference rate). Deployment on a Raspberry Pi 5 yielded an average inference latency of 112 ms, and on an iPhone 16 yielded 23.5 ms, confirming the feasibility for edge computation.

Implementation-level comparison under depolarizing noise", "summary": "Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) offer a promising architecture for near-term quantum machine learning by combining hierarchical feature extraction with modest parameter growth. However, any QCNN operating on classical data must rely on an encoding scheme to embed inputs into quantum states, and this choice can dominate both performance and resource requirements. This work presents an implementation-level comparison of three representative encodings -- Angle, Amplitude, and a Hybrid phase/angle scheme -- for QCNNs under depolarizing noise. We develop a fully differentiable PyTorch--Qiskit pipeline with a custom autograd bridge, batched parameter-shift gradients, and shot scheduling, and use it to train QCNNs on downsampled binary variants of MNIST and Fashion-MNIST at $4\\times 4$ and $8\\times 8$ resolutions.\n  Our experiments reveal regime-dependent trade-offs. On aggressively downsampled $4\\times 4$ inputs, Angle encoding attains higher accuracy and remains comparatively robust as noise increases, while the Hybrid encoder trails and exhibits non-monotonic trends. At $8\\times 8$, the Hybrid scheme can overtake Angle under moderate noise, suggesting that mixed phase/angle encoders benefit from additional feature bandwidth. Amplitude-encoded QCNNs are sparsely represented in the downsampled grids but achieve strong performance in lightweight and full-resolution configurations, where training dynamics closely resemble classical convergence. Taken together, these results provide practical guidance for choosing QCNN encoders under joint constraints of resolution, noise strength, and simulation budget."}

We first give the relation of the event horizon, photon sphere, and critical impact parameter in terms of the magnetic charge $q$. We then use the Event Horizon Telescope data to constrain $q$. For the two spherical accretion models, the infalling scenario yields a darker shadow due to the Doppler effect. However, the shadow radius remains unchanged for different models. In the case of an optically thin, geometrically thin disk accretion model, the observed brightness is predominantly determined by direct emission. The lensing ring provides a secondary contribution to the intensity, whereas the photon ring's emission is negligible. The widths of the lensing and photon rings exhibit a positive correlation with the magnetic charge $q$. Additionally, within the disk model framework, the black hole shadow radius is found to depend on the specific emission model."}

However, recent work suggests that relying on approximate symmetry can offer greater flexibility and robustness. Despite promising empirical evidence, there has been little theoretical understanding, and in particular, a direct comparison between exact and approximate symmetry is missing from the literature. In this paper, we initiate this study by asking: What is the cost of enforcing exact versus approximate symmetry? To address this question, we introduce averaging complexity, a framework for quantifying the cost of enforcing symmetry via averaging. Our main result is an exponential separation: under standard conditions, achieving exact symmetry requires linear averaging complexity, whereas approximate symmetry can be attained with only logarithmic averaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first theoretical separation of these two cases, formally justifying why approximate symmetry may be preferable in practice. Beyond this, our tools and techniques may be of independent interest for the broader study of symmetries in machine learning."}

With a constellation of satellites and a set of ground stations in a satellite-based QKD system, how to schedule satellites to achieve efficient QKD is an important problem. This problem has been studied in the dual-downlink architecture, where each satellite distributes pairs of entanglements to two ground stations simultaneously. However, it has not been studied in the single downlink architecture, where satellites create keys with each individual ground station, and then serve as trusted nodes to create keys between pairs of ground stations. While the single downlink architecture provides weaker security in that the satellites need to be trusted, it has many advantages, including the potential of achieving significantly higher key rates, and generating keys between pairs of ground stations that are far away from each other and cannot be served using the dual-downlink architecture. In this paper, we propose a novel opportunistic approach for satellite scheduling that accounts for fairness among the ground station pairs, while taking advantage of the dynamic satellite channels to maximize the system performance. We evaluate this approach in a wide range of settings and demonstrate that it provides the best tradeoffs in terms of total and minimum key rates across the ground station pairs. Our evaluation also highlights the importance of considering seasonal effects and cloud coverage in evaluating satellite-based QKD systems.

The first generalization consists in considering spaces with differential structures on them (the so-called ringed spaces) rather than the usual manifolds. This entails a generalization of the concept of smoothness, which allows us to think about a smooth passage through the singularity. The second generalization is related to the concept of curve. We show that if a kind of singularity is implanted in the set of curve's parameters, along with an appropriate topology, in such a way that the structure of the set of parameters corresponds to the structure of the singular space-time, the curve can smoothly -- in a generalized sense -- pass through the singularity."}

However, achieving efficient GNN inference on edge devices poses significant challenges, limiting their application in real-world edge scenarios. This is due to the high computational cost of GNNs and limited hardware resources on edge devices, which prevent GNN inference from meeting real-time and energy requirements. As an emerging paradigm, device-edge co-inference shows potential for improving inference efficiency and reducing energy consumption on edge devices. Despite its potential, research on GNN device-edge co-inference remains scarce, and our findings show that traditional model partitioning methods are ineffective for GNNs. To address this, we propose GCoDE, the first automatic framework for GNN architecture-mapping Co-design and deployment on Device-Edge hierarchies. By abstracting the device communication process into an explicit operation, GCoDE fuses the architecture and mapping scheme in a unified design space for joint optimization. Additionally, GCoDE's system performance awareness enables effective evaluation of architecture efficiency across diverse heterogeneous systems. By analyzing the energy consumption of various GNN operations, GCoDE introduces an energy prediction method that improves energy assessment accuracy and identifies energy-efficient solutions. Using a constraint-based random search strategy, GCoDE identifies the optimal solution in 1.5 hours, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the integrated co-inference engine in GCoDE enables efficient deployment and execution of GNN co-inference. Experimental results show that GCoDE can achieve up to 44.9x speedup and 98.2% energy reduction compared to existing approaches across diverse applications and system configurations."}

We consider a sample of several wormhole solutions and plasma distributions for which the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the light rays is separable. This allows us to derive analytical expressions for the shadow boundary and examine the behavior of the photon regions as the plasma frequency varies. We observe that plasma profiles which depend only on radial coordinate lead to common evolution of the photon region which does not depend on the wormhole metric and is consistent with the Kerr black hole. For plasma profiles with angular dependence the evolution of the photon region is specific for every spacetime thus wormholes are observationally distinguishable. We further investigate the formation of forbidden regions in the plasma medium where light cannot propagate. They lead to the formation of plasma frequency ranges where the shadow is no longer observable and we show that this phenomenon is characteristic for all the configurations in our sample. We obtain the critical frequencies for which the shadow vanishes and demonstrate that for all the wormholes they are lower than the critical frequencies for the Kerr black hole in the same environment. This implies that there exist plasma frequency ranges in which the Kerr black hole casts a shadow but wormholes do not, creating a strong observational signature for discriminating between compact objects. In the frequency ranges where both black hole and wormhole shadows exist the wormhole shadows are consistently smaller than those for the Kerr black hole. As the plasma frequency grows the discrepancy progresses showing that plasma medium facilitates the experimental detection of wormholes. Finally we consider aberrational effects on the wormhole shadows. They further increase the deviation from black holes making wormholes easier to detect."}

Working with local shell thermodynamics for gravastar and an exterior fiducial temperature, we show that the RR modification bends temperature to produce two extrema and a stable mass remnant at zero temperature. We show that the gravastar's shell entropy is smaller than that of a comparable black hole, and that RR modifications introduce a logarithmic correction which contributes to specific heat positivity and a smoother free energy landscape of small gravastars.\n  A Central finding of this work is that, from heat capacity and Helmholtz free energy analyses, we uncover small, middle, and large branches and demonstrate that unlike Rainbow modified black holes, the small RR gravastar is both locally and globally favored over hot curved space. At the parameter level, both Rastall and Rainbow play distinct roles. Increasing the Rastall parameter, by strengthening matter-curvature coupling, adjusts the redshift between the shell and the exterior, shifts the temperature maximum to higher values at larger masses, and narrows the unstable window. In contrast, increasing the Rainbow parameter enhances energy dependent UV suppression and bends the temperature in lower values at larger masses. Altogether, these results highlight a controlled route to thermodynamic stabilization and the emergence of a stable remnant in horizonless compact objects within RR gravity."}

Quantum error mitigation (QEM) offers a promising pathway to enhance computational accuracy on near-term devices, yet existing methods face a difficult trade-off between performance, resource overhead, and theoretical guarantees.

A key innovation is our 2-design training method, which generates training data for our machine learning model. In contrast to conventional learning-based QEM protocols that create training circuits by replacing non-Clifford gates with uniformly random Clifford gates, our approach achieves higher accuracy and efficiency, as demonstrated by both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Furthermore, we prove that the required size of the training set scales only \\emph{logarithmically} with the total number of neighbor circuits, enabling NIL to be applied to problems involving large-scale quantum circuits.

This motivates implementing quantum aspects of gravity through an independent connection. Moreover, the experimentally confirmed violation of Bell inequalities, together with the natural structure of the energy--momentum tensor in semiclassical gravity, suggests that nonlocality should be incorporated into the gravitational formalism. Motivated by these considerations, we propose a model in which the connection is treated as an independent bitensorial field, leading to a bitensorial generalization of the Einstein equations. The model reduces to General Relativity when the matter source is classical. We apply it in two regimes: the late-time universe and the Newtonian limit. In the cosmological case, the model naturally gives rise to a positive effective cosmological constant. In the Newtonian regime, we analyze a situation in which the gravitational source is in a quantum superposition and find that the model predicts a novel, nonconservative effective force that depends on the velocity of the test particle."}

We investigate fusion sensor arrays composed of both displacement-measuring seismometers and strain-measuring DAS-type sensors. We extend the Wiener filter formalism to mixed sensor types and introduce analytic S-wave strain correlation coefficients. Using a hybrid differential evolution and covariance matrix adaptation scheme, we validate our approach against established seismometer-only results and analyze the geometry, robustness, and performance of optimized fusion arrays. Fusion arrays enhance P/S-wave disentanglement and achieve NN cancellation levels comparable to, and sometimes exceeding, those of seismometer-only arrays, particularly for small sensor numbers.

From a single causal requirement, namely causal consistency, together with sharp measurements, reversible symmetries, and no-signaling, we show that any admissible state-to-probability map must be affine under mixing; otherwise, its curvature enables superluminal signaling via steering. Using standard reconstruction results, affinity forces the probability assignment to coincide with the quadratic transition function of complex quantum theory. Our three-stage argument (operational assignment, causal-consistency constraints, and structural reconstruction) recovers complex quantum theory and identifies Born's rule as a causal fixed point among admissible probabilistic laws.

We investigate a degenerate modification of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric obtained through a coordinate transformation applied to the radial coordinate, analogous to recent approaches that address the Big Bang singularity via spacetime defects. The resulting metric, while formally satisfying the standard homogeneous Friedmann equations, actually describes an evolving wormhole geometry with two asymptotically flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker regions connected by a throat located at the coordinate singularity. Using Israel's junction formalism, we demonstrate that this coordinate singularity corresponds to a thin shell characterized by exotic matter with well-defined surface energy density and isotropic pressure. The shell obeys the barotropic equation of state $p = -ρ/2$, confirming the presence of exotic matter that violates the standard energy condition, which is a requirement for maintaining wormhole geometries. As the universe expands, this thin shell becomes increasingly diluted, scaling as $1/a(t)$ with the cosmic scale factor."}

However, these systems face key challenges, including energy-constrained UAVs, stochastic task arrivals, and heterogeneous computing resources. To address these issues, we propose an integrated air-ground collaborative network and formulate a time-dependent integer nonlinear programming problem that jointly optimizes UAV trajectory planning and task offloading decisions. The problem is challenging to solve due to temporal coupling among decision variables. Therefore, we design a hierarchical learning framework with two timescales. At the large timescale, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism enables the energy-aware and incentive-compatible trajectory assignment. At the small timescale, we propose the diffusion-heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization, a generative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that embeds latent diffusion models into actor networks. Each UAV samples actions from a Gaussian prior and refines them via observation-conditioned denoising, enhancing adaptability and policy diversity.

While frame-change maps and frame-invariant resource sums are theoretically understood, their impact on circuit-based quantum information processing has largely remained unexplored. We formulate QRF transformations as circuit compilation rules and, for systems with finite Abelian symmetry described by the regular representation, derive a gate-level dictionary that maps local operations in one frame to their images in another. This yields a group-theoretic classification of gates where symmetry-commuting operators remain local, up to frame-dependent phases, while generic gates are promoted to controlled entangling operations in which the original frame acts as a control register. The resulting frame-dependence entangling-gate count defines a relational circuit complexity where the cost of a computation depends on the internal reference frame of the observer. We instantiate the framework in a three-qubit model and show that the QRF unitary acts as a lossless converter between a purity-based local coherence and concurrence, preserving their invariant sum and giving a concrete realization of the relativity of entanglement. We implement the corresponding circuits on an IBM Quantum superconducting platform, using full state tomography to reconstruct the redistribution of resources between internal frames. The hardware data reproduce the predicted conversion of local coherence into entanglement, and the observed deviations from exact conservation quantify the effect of realistic device noise on relational quantum protocols."}

Depending on the values of these parameters $V_{eff}$ becomes a double barrier potential. We quantize the model and obtain the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We solve that equation using the WKB approximation and compute the corresponding probability ($TP_{WKB}$) that the wavefunction of the universe tunnels through the double barrier potential $V_{eff}$. We study how $TP_{WKB}$ behaves as a function of the parameters $A$, $B$, $σ$ and the radiation energy $E$.

We unify these within a single explanatory framework, the geometry of the loss and error landscapes. We analytically show that phase transitions in DNN learning are governed by saddle points in the loss landscape. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple, fast, and easy to implement algorithm that uses the L2 regularizer as a tool to probe the geometry of error landscapes. We apply it to confirm mode connectivity in DNNs trained on the MNIST dataset by efficiently finding paths that connect global minima. We then show numerically that saddle points induce transitions between models that encode distinct digit classes.

Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are widely used for interpreting black-box models by showing the average effect of an input variable on the prediction. However, their global sensitivity metric can be misleading when strong interactions are present, as averaging tends to obscure interaction effects. To address this limitation, we propose a global sensitivity metric based on Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves. The method computes the expected feature importance across ICE curves, along with their standard deviation, to more effectively capture the influence of interactions. We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that the PDP-based sensitivity is a lower bound of the proposed ICE-based metric under truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion. In addition, we introduce an ICE-based correlation value to quantify how interactions modify the relationship between inputs and the output. Comparative evaluations were performed on three cases: a 5-variable analytical function, a 5-variable wind-turbine fatigue problem, and a 9-variable airfoil aerodynamics case, where ICE-based sensitivity was benchmarked against PDP, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Sobol' indices.

Although current implementations rely on quantum circuit simulators constrained to few-qubit regimes, the results highlight the potential of quantum encodings to alleviate spectral bias in implicit representations. Q-NeRF provides a foundational step toward scalable quantum-enabled 3D scene reconstruction and a baseline for future quantum neural rendering research."}

They predicted that quantum paths exhibit a universal Hausdorff dimension that transitions from $d=2$ to $d=1$ as the momentum of the particle increases. However, although measurements were assumed to occur at intervals of time, the calculations only involved evaluating the expectation value of operators for the free evolution of wave function within a single interval, with no actual physical measurements performed. In this work we investigate how quantum measurements alter the fractal geometry of quantum particle paths. By modelling sequential measurements using Gaussian wave packets for both the particle and the apparatus, we reveal that the dynamics of the measurement change the roughness of the path and shift the emergent Hausdorff dimension towards a lower value in nonselective evolution. For selective evolution, feedback control forces must be introduced to counteract stochastic wave function collapse, stabilising trajectories and enabling dimensionality to be tuned. When the contribution of the measurement approaches zero, our result reduces to that of Abbott et al. Our work can thus be regarded as a more realistic formulation of their approach, and it connects theoretical quantum fractality with measurement physics, quantifying how detectors reshape spacetime statistics at quantum scales."}

However, its worst-case robustness under a misalignment threat model--where a model might learn to actively conceal its internal states--remains untested. Focusing on this threat model, we ask: could a model learn to evade previously unseen activation monitors? Our core contribution is to stress-test the learnability of this behavior. We demonstrate that finetuning can create Neural Chameleons: models capable of zero-shot evading activation monitors. Specifically, we fine-tune an LLM to evade monitors for a set of benign concepts (e.g., languages, HTML) when conditioned on a trigger of the form: \"You are being probed for {concept}\". We show that this learned mechanism generalizes zero-shot: by substituting {concept} with a safety-relevant term like 'deception', the model successfully evades previously unseen safety monitors. We validate this phenomenon across diverse model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), showing that the evasion succeeds even against monitors trained post hoc on the model's frozen weights. This evasion is highly selective, targeting only the specific concept mentioned in the trigger, and having a modest impact on model capabilities on standard benchmarks. Using Gemma-2-9b-it as a case study, a mechanistic analysis reveals this is achieved via a targeted manipulation that moves activations into a low-dimensional subspace. While stronger defenses like monitor ensembles and non-linear classifiers show greater resilience, the model retains a non-trivial evasion capability. Our work provides a proof-of-concept for this failure mode and a tool to evaluate the worst-case robustness of monitoring techniques against misalignment threat models."}

A wide range of classical machine learning methods, as well as more recent quantum machine learning approaches, have been investigated to address this challenge, each providing valuable progress but also leaving open questions regarding scalability, robustness, and adaptability to evolving fraud patterns. In this work, we introduce the Fidelity-based Quantum Autoencoder (FiD-QAE), a quantum architecture that employs fidelity estimation as the decision criterion for anomaly detection. Transactions are encoded into quantum states, compressed through a variational quantum circuit, and evaluated using the SWAP test to distinguish legitimate from fraudulent transactions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of FiD-QAE, including statistical analyses, multiple performance metrics, and robustness tests under quantum noise models. The results show that FiD-QAE maintains consistent performance across different imbalance levels and preserves robustness in noisy conditions. Moreover, validation on IBM Quantum hardware backends confirms the feasibility of our approach on real devices, with outcomes consistent with simulation. These findings position quantum fidelity as a powerful criterion for anomaly detection and highlight FiD-QAE as a promising direction that complements existing classical and quantum approaches, offering robustness and generalizability for financial fraud detection in realistic environments."}

Misinterpreting intent or risks may lead to unsafe outputs, while overly cautious interpretations can cause unnecessary refusal of benign requests. In this paper, we question the conventional framework in which LLMs generate immediate responses to requests without considering broader contextual factors. User requests are situated within broader contexts such as intentions, knowledge, and prior experience, which strongly influence what constitutes an appropriate answer. We propose a framework that extracts and leverages such contextual information from the user prompt itself. Specifically, a reinforcement learning based context generator, designed in an autoencoder-like fashion, is trained to infer contextual signals grounded in the prompt and use them to guide response generation. This approach is particularly important for safety tasks, where ambiguous requests may bypass safeguards while benign but confusing requests can trigger unnecessary refusals. Experiments show that our method reduces harmful responses by an average of 5.6% on the SafetyInstruct dataset across multiple foundation models and improves the harmonic mean of attack success rate and compliance on benign prompts by 6.2% on XSTest and WildJailbreak. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of context extraction for safer and more reliable LLM inferences."}

We propose Eikonal-Constrained Quasimetric RL (Eik-QRL), a continuous-time reformulation of QRL based on the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE). This PDE-based structure makes Eik-QRL trajectory-free, requiring only sampled states and goals, while improving out-of-distribution generalization. We provide theoretical guarantees for Eik-QRL and identify limitations that arise under complex dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Eik-Hierarchical QRL (Eik-HiQRL), which integrates Eik-QRL into a hierarchical decomposition.

It is usually considered for the processing of quantum bits (qubits) and its efficient implementation is obtained with two elementary components: the Hadamard gate and the controlled--phase gate. In this paper, the quantum Fourier transform operating with continuous variables (cvQFT) is considered. Thus, the environment becomes the Hilbert space, where the natural definition of the cvQFT will be related to rotation operators, which in the $N$--mode are completely specified by unitary matrices of order $N$. Then the cvQFT is defined as the rotation operator whose rotation matrix is given by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. For the implementation of rotation operators with primitive components (single--mode rotations and beam splitters), we follow the well known Murnaghan procedure, with appropriate modifications. Moreover, algorithms related to the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are applied to reduce drastically the implementation complexity. The final part is concerned with the application of the cvQFT to general Gaussian states. In particular, we show that cvQFT has the simple effect of transforming the displacement vector by a one-dimensional DFT, the squeeze matrix by a two-dimensional DFT, and the rotation matrix by a Fourier-like similarity transform."}

Our Safety Stability Index (SSI) reveals that higher temperatures significantly reduce decision stability (Friedman chi-squared = 44.71, p < 0.001), with mean SSI dropping from 0.951 at temperature 0.0 to 0.896 at temperature 1.0. We validate our findings across all model families using Claude 3.5 Haiku as a unified external judge, achieving 89.0% inter-judge agreement with our primary Llama 70B judge (Cohen's kappa = 0.62).

However, the evolution of quantum coherence for light beams undergoing fundamental optical processes at dielectric interfaces remains unexplored. Furthermore, manipulating multiphoton correlations typically requires complex interactions that challenge few-photon level implementation. Here, we introduce a quantum van Cittert-Zernike theorem for light beams, describing how their coherence-polarization properties are influenced by reflection and refraction, as well as how these properties evolve upon subsequent propagation. Our work demonstrates that the quantum statistics of photonic systems can be controllably modified through the inherent polarization coupling arising from reflection and refraction at an interface, without relying on conventional light-matter interactions. Our approach reveals regimes where thermal light can exhibit sub-Poissonian statistics with fluctuations below the shot-noise level through post-selected measurements, and this statistical property can be tuned by the incident angle. Remarkably, this quantum statistical modification is governed by a scaling law linking beam collimation to far-field thermalization. Our work establishes a robust, decoherence-avoiding mechanism for quantum state control, advancing the fundamental understanding of coherence in quantum optics and opening new avenues for applications in quantum information and metrology."}

Such models generate multi-step forecasts either directly, by predicting the full horizon at once, or iteratively, by feeding back their own predictions at each step. In both cases, the multi-step forecasts are prone to errors. To address this, we propose a Predictor-Corrector mechanism where the Predictor is any learned time-series model and the Corrector is a neural controlled differential equation. The Predictor forecasts, and the Corrector predicts the errors of the forecasts. Adding these errors to the forecasts improves forecast performance. The proposed Corrector works with irregularly sampled time series and continuous- and discrete-time Predictors. Additionally, we introduce two regularization strategies to improve the extrapolation performance of the Corrector with accelerated training. We evaluate our Corrector with diverse Predictors, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations, Contiformer, and DLinear, on synthetic, physics simulation, and real-world forecasting datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the Predictor-Corrector mechanism consistently improves the performance compared to Predictor alone."}

Using the Fermi-Hubbard model on lattices up to 3x3, we show that this breakdown appears at half-filling on the 2x2 lattice and extends to both half-filled and doped configurations on the 3x3 lattice.

They predicted that quantum paths exhibit a universal Hausdorff dimension that transitions from $d=2$ to $d=1$ as the momentum of the particle increases. However, although measurements were assumed to occur at intervals of time, the calculations only involved evaluating the expectation value of operators for the free evolution of wave function within a single interval, with no actual physical measurements performed. In this work we investigate how quantum measurements alter the fractal geometry of quantum particle paths. By modelling sequential measurements using Gaussian wave packets for both the particle and the apparatus, we reveal that the dynamics of the measurement change the roughness of the path and shift the emergent Hausdorff dimension towards a lower value in nonselective evolution. For selective evolution, feedback control forces must be introduced to counteract stochastic wave function collapse, stabilising trajectories and enabling dimensionality to be tuned. When the contribution of the measurement approaches zero, our result reduces to that of Abbott et al. Our work can thus be regarded as a more realistic formulation of their approach, and it connects theoretical quantum fractality with measurement physics, quantifying how detectors reshape spacetime statistics at quantum scales."}

Recent works have focused on developing transformer-based neurofoundation models of such recordings that can generalize across subjects and datasets. However, these recordings exhibit highly complex spatiotemporal interactions across diverse spatial scales, from the single-channel scale to the scale of brain regions. As such, there remain critical open questions regarding how best to encode spatial information and how to design self-supervision tasks that enable the learning of brain network patterns and enhance downstream decoding performance using such high-dimensional, multiregional recordings. To allow for exploring these questions, we propose a new spatiotemporal transformer model of multiregional neural activity and a corresponding self-supervised masked latent reconstruction task, designed to enable flexibility in the spatial scale used for token encoding and masking. Applying this model on publicly available multiregional intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) data, we demonstrate that adjusting the spatial scale for both token encoding and masked reconstruction significantly impacts downstream decoding. Further, we find that spatial encoding at larger scales than channel-level encoding, which is commonly used in existing iEEG transformer models, improves downstream decoding performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our method allows for region-level token encoding while also maintaining accurate channel-level neural reconstruction. Taken together, our modeling framework enables exploration of the spatial scales used for token encoding and masking, reveals their importance towards self-supervised pretraining of neurofoundation models of multiregional human brain activity, and enhances downstream decoding performance."}

A hierarchy of separable neural quantum states is trained on finite-shot local Pauli outcomes and compared against an unconstrained reference model trained on the same data. When all constrained models are statistically disfavored, the data certify entanglement beyond the imposed limit directly from measurement statistics, without reconstructing the density matrix.

To address these limitations, we developed HydroDiffusion, a diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework with a decoder-only state space model backbone.

Results show that HydroDiffusion achieves strong nowcast accuracy when driven by observed meteorological forcings, and maintains consistent performance across the full simulation horizon. Moreover, HydroDiffusion delivers stronger deterministic and probabilistic forecast skill than DRUM in operational forecasting.

While the quantum Kibble-Zurek (QKZ) mechanism predicts universal scaling during quenches across a critical point, real quantum systems exhibit complex decoherence that can substantially modify these behaviors, ranging from altering critical scaling to completely suppressing it. By considering a specific case of nondemolishing noise, we first show how decoherence can reshape universal scaling and verify these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of spin chains across a wide range of noise strengths. Then, we study linear quenches in the transverse-field Ising model on IBM superconducting processors where the noise model is unknown. Using large system sizes of 80-120 qubits, we measure equal-time connected correlations, defect densities, and excess energies across various quench times. Surprisingly, unlike earlier observations where noise-induced defect production masked universal behavior at long times, we observe clear scaling relations, pointing towards persistent universal structure shaped by decoherence. The extracted scaling exponents differ from both ideal QKZ predictions and analytic results for simplified noise models, suggesting the emergence of a distinct noise-influenced universality regime. Our results, therefore, point toward the possibility of using universal dynamical scaling as a high-level descriptor of quantum hardware, complementary to conventional gate-level performance metrics."}

In this work we investigate the use of a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter (MF-EnKF) in which the low-fidelity model is such a machine learning surrogate model, instead of a traditional low-resolution or reduced-order model. The idea behind this is to use an ensemble of a few expensive full model runs, together with an ensemble of many cheap but less accurate ML model runs. In this way we hope to reach increased accuracy within the same computational budget. We investigate the performance by testing the approach on two common test problems, namely the Lorenz-2005 model and the Quasi-Geostrophic model. By keeping the original physical model in place, we obtain a higher accuracy than when we completely replace it by the ML model. Furthermore, the MF-EnKF reaches improved accuracy within the same computational budget. The ML surrogate has similar or improved accuracy compared to the low-resolution one, but it can provide a larger speed-up. Our method contributes to increasing the effective ensemble size in the EnKF, which improves the estimation of the initial condition and hence accuracy of the predictions in fields such as meteorology and oceanography."}

To show the utility of this setup, we demonstrate the generation of displaced higher photon states with unit fidelity and the family of Schrodinger cat states above $98\\%$ fidelity. In addition, we manifest the generation of GKP resource states, such as ON states and weak cubic phase states with $99\\%$ fidelity. Creating such a variety of important states in this single setup is made feasible by stating the output in the form of displaced qudits. This figure of merit facilitates efficient identification and optimization of input parameters required to generate the target single mode quantum states. We also account for the experimental imperfections by incorporating detector inefficiencies and non-unit single photon sources. This cascaded setup will assist the experimentalists to explore the feasible creation of target states using currently available resources, such as single photon sources and single photon detectors."}

Various uncertainty measures have been proposed for this purpose, typically claiming superiority over other measures. In this paper, we argue that there is no single best measure. Instead, uncertainty quantification should be tailored to the specific application. To this end, we use a flexible family of uncertainty measures that distinguishes between total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty of second-order distributions. These measures can be instantiated with specific loss functions, so-called proper scoring rules, to control their characteristics, and we show that different characteristics are useful for different tasks. In particular, we show that, for the task of selective prediction, the scoring rule should ideally match the task loss. On the other hand, for out-of-distribution detection, our results confirm that mutual information, a widely used measure of epistemic uncertainty, performs best. Furthermore, in an active learning setting, epistemic uncertainty based on zero-one loss is shown to consistently outperform other uncertainty measures."}

Although a quantum-assisted hierarchical fuzzy neural network (QA-HFNN) was proposed to learn fuzzy membership for each feature, it cannot model dependencies between features due to its single-qubit encoding. To address this, this paper proposes a dual-qubit hierarchical fuzzy neural network (DQ-HFNN), encoding feature pairs onto a pair of entangled qubits, which extends the single-feature fuzzy model to a joint fuzzy representation. By introducing quantum entanglement, the dual-qubit circuit can encode non-classical correlations, enabling the model to directly learn relationship patterns between feature pairs. Experiments on benchmarks show that DQ-HFNN demonstrates higher classification accuracy than QA-HFNN, as well as classical deep learning baselines. Furthermore, ablation studies after controlling for circuit depth and parameter counts show that the performance gain mainly stems from the relational modeling capability enabled by entanglement rather than enhanced expressivity. The proposed DQ-HFNN model exhibits high parameter efficiency and fast inference speed. Experiments under noisy conditions suggest that it is robust against noise and has the potential to be implemented on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices."}

A data-efficiency frontier further shows that both models move toward improved specialization with negligible mixed-domain degradation.

However, current adaptations of GRPO for the flow matching-based image generation neglect a foundational conflict between its core principles and the distinct dynamics of the visual synthesis process. This mismatch leads to two key limitations: (i) Uniformly applying a sparse terminal reward across all timesteps impairs temporal credit assignment, ignoring the differing criticality of generation phases from early structure formation to late-stage tuning. (ii) Exclusive reliance on relative, intra-group rewards causes the optimization signal to fade as training converges, leading to the optimization stagnation when reward diversity is entirely depleted. To address these limitations, we propose Value-Anchored Group Policy Optimization (VGPO), a framework that redefines value estimation across both temporal and group dimensions. Specifically, VGPO transforms the sparse terminal reward into dense, process-aware value estimates, enabling precise credit assignment by modeling the expected cumulative reward at each generative stage. Furthermore, VGPO replaces standard group normalization with a novel process enhanced by absolute values to maintain a stable optimization signal even as reward diversity declines. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that VGPO achieves state-of-the-art image quality while simultaneously improving task-specific accuracy, effectively mitigating reward hacking.

Here, we present a framework for a generic, two-stroke quantum heat engine interacting with $N$ thermal baths and Maxwell's demon. The demon performs projective measurements on the engine working substance, the outcome of which is recorded in a classical memory, embedded in its own thermal bath. To perform feedback control, the demon enacts unitary operations on the working substance, conditioned on the recorded outcome. By considering the compound machine-memory as a hybrid (classical-quantum) standard thermal machine interacting with $N+1$ thermal baths, our framework puts the working substance and memory on equal footing, thereby enabling a comprehensible resolution to Maxwell's paradox. We illustrate the application of our framework with a two-qubit engine. A remarkable observation is that more information does not necessarily result in better thermodynamic performance: sometimes knowing less is better."}

The framework jointly optimizes LSMM and SAM loss with a conventional Huber loss objective, promoting both numerical accuracy and geometric consistency in the feature space.

However, in the context of controlling ``chaotic'' quantum unitary dynamics, the situation is far more tenuous. The classical concepts of exponential sensitivity to trajectory initial conditions and ergodicity do not directly translate into quantum unitary evolution. Nevertheless properties inherent to quantum chaos can take on those roles: i) the dynamical sensitivity to weak perturbations, measured by the fidelity decay, serves a similar purpose as the classical sensitivity to initial conditions; and ii) paired with the fact that quantum chaotic systems are conjectured to be statistically described by random matrix theory, implies a method to translate the ergodic feature into the control of quantum dynamics. With those two properties, it can be argued that quantum chaotic dynamical systems, in principle, allow for full controllability beyond a characteristic time that scales only logarithmically with system size and $\\hbar^{-1}$. In the spirit of classical targeting, it implies that it is possible to fine tune the immense quantum interference with weak perturbations and steer the system from any initial state into any desired target state, subject to constraints imposed by conserved quantities. In contrast, integrable dynamics possess neither ergodicity nor exponential instability, and thus the weak perturbations apparently must break the integrability for control purposes. The main ideas are illustrated with the quantum kicked rotor. The production of revivals, cat-like entangled states, and the transition from any random state to any other random state is possible as demonstrated."}

In numerical experiments we study examples where we observe for a 1D Ising chain with nearest-neighbor interactions that the RGD steps needed to prepare a ground state scales linearly with the number of spins. For all-to-all couplings a quadratic scaling is obtained. To achieve efficient implementations while keeping convergence guarantees, we develop RGD approximations by randomly projecting the Riemannian gradient into polynomial-sized subspaces. We find that the speed of convergence of the randomly projected RGD critically depends on the size of the subspace the gradient is projected into. Finally, we develop efficient quantum device implementations based on Trotterization and a quantum stochastic drift-inspired protocol. We implement the resulting quantum algorithms on IBM's quantum devices and provide data for small-scale problems."}

Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models."}

Existing nonlinear models of multimodal neural activity do not address different timescales or missing samples across modalities. Further, some of these models do not allow for real-time decoding. Here, we develop a learning framework that can enable real-time recursive decoding while nonlinearly aggregating information across multiple modalities with different timescales and distributions and with missing samples. This framework consists of 1) a multiscale encoder that nonlinearly aggregates information after learning within-modality dynamics to handle different timescales and missing samples in real time, 2) a multiscale dynamical backbone that extracts multimodal temporal dynamics and enables real-time recursive decoding, and 3) modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions across modalities. In both simulations and three distinct multiscale brain datasets, we show that our model can aggregate information across modalities with different timescales and distributions and missing samples to improve real-time target decoding.

To make this paradigm tractable, TM employs a large backbone network and a smaller \"head\" module to efficiently execute the generative transition step. In this work, we present a large-scale, systematic investigation into the design, training and sampling of the head in TM frameworks, focusing on its time-continuous bidirectional variant. Through comprehensive ablations and experimentation involving training 56 different 1.7B text-to-image models (resulting in 549 unique evaluations) we evaluate the affect of the head module architecture and modeling during training as-well as a useful family of stochastic TM samplers. We analyze the impact on generation quality, training, and inference efficiency. We find that TM with an MLP head, trained with a particular time weighting and sampled with high frequency sampler provides best ranking across all metrics reaching state-of-the-art among all tested baselines, while Transformer head with sequence scaling and low frequency sampling is a runner up excelling at image aesthetics.

Most previous studies have focused on the single-particle case in the far-field regime, where both approaches yield very similar arrival-time distributions and a semi-classical analysis typically suffices. Recent advances in atom-optics technologies now make it possible to experimentally investigate arrival-time distributions for entangled multi-particle systems in the near-field regime, where a deeper analysis beyond semi-classical approximations is required. Even in the far-field regime, due to quantum non-locality, the semi-classical approximation cannot generally hold in multi-particle systems. Therefore, in this work, two fundamental approaches to the arrival-time problem -- namely, the time-parameter and time-operator approaches -- are extended to multi-particle systems. Using these extensions, we propose a feasible two-particle arrival-time experiment and numerically evaluate the corresponding joint distributions. Our results reveal regimes in which the two approaches yield inequivalent predictions, highlighting conditions under which experiments could shed new light on distinguishing between competing accounts of time in quantum mechanics. Our findings also provide important insights for the development of quantum technologies that use entanglement in the time domain, including non-local temporal interferometry, temporal ghost imaging, and temporal state tomography in multi-particle systems."}

The anchored geometry enables two practical interventions: reversible behavioral steering that projects out a concept's latent component at inference, and permanent removal via targeted weight ablation of anchored dimensions. Experiments on structured autoencoders show selective attenuation of targeted concepts with negligible impact on orthogonal features, and complete elimination with reconstruction error approaching theoretical bounds. Sparse Concept Anchoring therefore provides a practical pathway to interpretable, steerable behavior in learned representations."}

First, we propose a physical mechanism based on decoherence-free subspaces. Second, we show that an exponential enhancement of the decay rate toward equilibrium, scaling with system size, can be obtained, leading to an extreme version of the phenomenon in Markovian open quantum systems. Third, we study the strong Mpemba effect through the unravelings of Davies maps, revealing subtleties in the choice of figures of merit used to identify the QME.

Unlike ESAN's bag-based representation, GoMS constructs a graph where nodes represent subgraphs and edges capture their structural relationships, preserving critical topological information about how substructures are connected and overlap within the molecule. Through extensive experiments on public molecular datasets, we demonstrate that GoMS outperforms ESAN and other baseline methods, with particularly improvements for large molecules containing more than 100 atoms. The performance gap widens as molecular size increases, demonstrating GoMS's effectiveness for modeling industrial-scale molecules. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GoMS can distinguish molecules with identical subgraph compositions but different spatial arrangements.

For that purpose, dequantization algorithms play a central role in providing a clear theoretical framework to separate the complexity of quantum and classical algorithms. However, existing dequantized algorithms typically rely on sampling procedures, leading to prohibitively large computational overheads and hindering their practical implementation on classical computers. In this work, we propose a tensor network-based dequantization framework for GSEE that eliminates the sampling process while preserving the asymptotic complexity of prior dequantized algorithms. In our formulation, the overhead arising from sampling is replaced by the growth of the bond dimension required to represent Chebyshev vectors as tensor network states. Consequently, physical structure, such as entanglement and locality, is naturally reflected in the computational cost. By combining this approach with tensor network approximations, such as Matrix Product States (MPS), we construct a practical dequantization algorithm that is executable within realistic computational resources. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method can efficiently construct high-degree polynomials up to $d=10^4$ for Hamiltonians with up to $100$ qubits, explicitly revealing the crossover between classically tractable and quantum advantaged regimes. These results indicate that tensor network-based dequantization provides a crucial tool toward the rigorous, quantitative verification of quantum advantage in realistic many-body systems."}

In this paper, we take an important step toward addressing these deficiencies.\n  To begin with, we use historical data from UNOS to develop a new simulator that enables us to evaluate and compare the performance of different policies. We then leverage our simulator to demonstrate that the status quo policy is considerably inferior to the myopic policy that matches incoming donors to the patient who maximizes the number of years gained by the transplant. Moreover, we develop improved policies that account for the dynamic nature of the allocation process through the use of potentials -- a measure of a patient's utility in future allocations that we introduce. We also show that batching together even a handful of donors -- which is a viable option for a certain type of donors -- further enhances performance. Our simulator also allows us to evaluate the effect of critical, and often unexplored, factors in the allocation, such as geographic proximity and the tendency to reject offers by the transplant centers."}

Our results show that this multi-qubit strategy significantly reduces the number of required operations, offering a pathway to more efficient, shallower, and more coherent circuits for spin-qubit processors."}

Using CEEMDAN, we extract nine IMFs spanning high-frequency fluctuations to long-term trends. Each IMF is transformed into a graph using four time-series-to-graph methods: natural visibility, horizontal visibility, recurrence, and transition graphs. Topological analysis shows clear scale-dependent structure: high-frequency IMFs yield dense, highly connected small-world graphs, whereas low-frequency IMFs produce sparser networks with longer characteristic path lengths. Visibility-based methods are more sensitive to amplitude variability and typically generate higher clustering, while recurrence graphs better preserve temporal dependencies. These results provide guidance for designing GNN architectures tailored to the structural properties of decomposed components, supporting more effective predictive modeling of financial time series."}

Small shifts in the behavior of these users are often sufficient to propagate widely throughout the network. A similar phenomenon occurs during neural network fine tuning. Conventional fine tuning of convolutional neural networks typically adds a new linear classification layer on top of a large pre trained model. Instead we argue that improved adaptation can be achieved by first pruning the network to retain only the most important neurons and then performing fine tuning.\n  We propose a graph theory based method for pruning neural networks that is designed to improve fine tuning performance. In this method each neuron is represented as a node and edges encode similarity between neurons. Neurons are pruned based on importance scores computed using eigenvector centrality. The resulting pruned network is then fine tuned using only the most central neurons. We evaluate the proposed method on VGGNet EfficientNet and ResNet models using the TF Flowers Caltech one zero one and Oxford Flowers one zero two datasets. The proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy while significantly reducing model complexity. On the Oxford Flowers one zero two dataset the method achieves forty eight percent classification accuracy compared to thirty percent accuracy obtained by the baseline VGGNet model."}

We consider a bosonic model with two phase-shift parameters and analyze the performance of second- and third-order nonlinear scrambling using two classes of probe states: squeezed vacuum states and coherent states. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear scrambling mitigates sloppiness, increases compatibility, and improves overall estimation precision. We find third-order nonlinearity to be more effective than second-order under both fixed-probe and fixed-energy constraints. Furthermore, by comparing joint estimation to a stepwise estimation strategy, we show that a threshold for nonlinear coupling exists. For coherent probes, joint estimation outperforms the stepwise strategy if the nonlinearity is sufficiently large, while for squeezed probes, this advantage is observed specifically with third-order nonlinearity."}

The computational overhead (approximately 200x slower than classical ACGAN) reflects simulator artifacts rather than inherent quantum costs.\n  On MNIST, we observe that the energy-regularized model (termed QACGAN) achieves high classification accuracy (99 to 100 percent) within 5 epochs compared to 87.8 percent for ACGAN, suggesting the auxiliary term influences class conditioning. However, sample quality metrics (FID) show high variance across runs (coefficient of variation approximately 25 percent at epoch 5), with values ranging from 19.92 to 35.96. Extended runs stabilize around FID 23 to 24, comparable to the ACGAN baseline.\n  We explicitly do not claim quantum advantage, improved stability in any general sense, or scalability beyond this toy setting.

We point out that the relevant mechanism is not intrinsically field-theoretic, but is essentially a quantum tunneling/evanescent matter channel, which is already captured within ordinary quantum mechanics. More importantly, the microscopic constituents of realistic macroscopic objects are bound and localized by strong potentials, introducing a large internal energy scale that suppresses coherent propagation between distant bodies. Including such binding/localization generically yields an exponential suppression, rendering the matter-mediated contribution negligible at the macroscopic separations relevant to gravitational-entanglement proposals.

In structural causal models with discrete classical variables, observational data and even ideal interventions generally fail to answer all counterfactual questions, since different causal parameters can reproduce the same observational and interventional data while disagreeing on counterfactuals. Using a simple binary example, we demonstrate that if the classical variables of interest are encoded in quantum systems and the causal dependence among them is encoded in a quantum oracle, coherently querying the oracle enables the identification of all causal parameters -- hence all classical counterfactuals. We generalize this to arbitrary finite cardinalities and prove that coherent probing 1) allows the identification of all two-way joint counterfactuals p(Y_x=y, Y_{x'}=y'), which is not possible with any number of queries to a classical oracle, and 2) provides tighter bounds on higher-order multi-way counterfactuals than with a classical oracle. This work can also be viewed as an extension to traditional quantum oracle problems such as Deutsch--Jozsa to identifying more causal parameters beyond just, e.g., whether a function is constant or balanced. Finally, we raise the question of whether this quantum advantage relies on uniquely non-classical features like contextuality. We provide some evidence against this by showing that in the binary case, oracles in some classically-explainable theories like Spekkens' toy theory also give rise to a counterfactual identifiability advantage over strictly classical oracles."}

This narrows the gap between training and validation performance and improves reliability on unseen data, as evident from the experiments.\n  Although superficially similar to DropConnect, PerNodeDrop operates at the sample level. It drops weights at the sample level, not the batch level. An expected-loss analysis formalizes how its perturbations attenuate excessive co-adaptation while retaining predictive interactions. Empirical evaluations on vision, text, and audio benchmarks indicate improved generalization relative to the standard noise-based regularizer."}

Depending on the temporal position of the query, the task is categorized into interpolation and extrapolation. Existing interpolation methods typically embed temporal information into individual facts to complete missing historical knowledge, while extrapolation techniques often leverage sequence models over graph snapshots to identify recurring patterns for future event prediction. These methods face two critical challenges: limited contextual modeling in interpolation and cognitive generalization bias in extrapolation. To address these, we propose a unified method for TKGR, dubbed DynaGen. For interpolation, DynaGen dynamically constructs entity-centric subgraphs and processes them with a synergistic dual-branch GNN encoder to capture evolving structural context. For extrapolation, it applies a conditional diffusion process, which forces the model to learn underlying evolutionary principles rather than just superficial patterns, enhancing its ability to predict unseen future events. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show DynaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance. On average, compared to the second-best models, DynaGen improves the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) score by 2.61 points for interpolation and 1.45 points for extrapolation."}

While continuous-time bridges promise faster sampling, overparameterized neural networks describe their optimal dynamics, and the underlying stochastic differential equations can be difficult to integrate efficiently. This work introduces a novel paradigm that uses surrogate models to create simpler, faster, and more flexible approximations of these dynamics. We propose two specific algorithms: SINDy Flow Matching (SINDy-FM), which leverages sparse regression to identify interpretable, symbolic differential equations from data, and a Neural-ODE reformulation of the Schrödinger Bridge (DSBM-NeuralODE) for flexible continuous-time parameterization. Our experiments on Gaussian transport tasks and MNIST latent translation demonstrate that these surrogates achieve competitive performance while offering dramatic improvements in efficiency and interpretability. The symbolic SINDy-FM models, in particular, reduce parameter counts by several orders of magnitude and enable near-instantaneous inference, paving the way for a new class of tractable and high-performing bridge models for practical deployment."}

We study the family of functions obtainable by holding a Transformer backbone fixed as an executor and varying only the prompt. Our core idea is to view the prompt as an externally injected program and to construct a simplified Transformer that interprets it to implement different computations. The construction exposes a mechanism-level decomposition: attention performs selective routing from prompt memory, the FFN performs local arithmetic conditioned on retrieved fragments, and depth-wise stacking composes these local updates into a multi-step computation. Under this viewpoint, we prove a constructive existential result showing that a single fixed backbone can approximate a broad class of target behaviors via prompts alone. The framework provides a unified starting point for formalizing trade-offs under prompt length/precision constraints and for studying structural limits of prompt-based switching, while remaining distinct from empirical claims about pretrained LLMs."}

Many studies suggest that introducing the SFT stage not only fails to improve reasoning ability but may also negatively impact model training. In this study, we revisit this RL-centric belief through a systematic and controlled comparison of SFT and RL on VLM Reasoning. Using identical data sources, we find that the relative effectiveness of SFT and RL is conditional and strongly influenced by model capacity, data scale, and data distribution. Contrary to common assumptions, our findings show that SFT plays a crucial role across several scenarios: (1) Effectiveness for weaker models. SFT more reliably elicits reasoning capabilities in smaller or weaker VLMs. (2) Data efficiency. SFT with only 2K achieves comparable or better reasoning performance to RL with 20K. (3) Cross-modal transferability. SFT demonstrates stronger generalization across modalities. Moreover, we identify a pervasive issue of deceptive rewards, where higher rewards fail to correlate with better reasoning accuracy in RL. These results challenge the prevailing \"RL over SFT\" narrative. They highlight that the role of SFT may have been underestimated and support a more balanced post-training pipeline in which SFT and RL function as complementary components."}

In this regard, we identify two key sources of epistemic uncertainty, namely structural uncertainty in the latent reward dependencies across arms and tasks, and user-specific uncertainty due to incomplete context and limited interaction history. To put our method into practice, we represent the joint distribution over tasks and rewards using a particle-based approximation of a log-density Gaussian process. This representation enables flexible, data-driven discovery of both inter-arm and inter-task dependencies without prior assumptions on the latent variables. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines such as hierarchical model bandits, especially in settings with model misspecification or complex latent heterogeneity."}

Structural pruning, which reduces model size by removing redundant computational units such as neurons, has been widely explored as a solution, and this study devotes to input sparsification, an increasingly popular technique that improves efficiency by selectively activating only a subset of entry values for each input. However, existing approaches focus primarily on computational savings, often overlooking the representational consequences of sparsification and leaving a noticeable performance gap compared to full models. In this work, we first reinterpret input sparsification as a form of dynamic structural pruning. Motivated by the spontaneous baseline firing rates observed in biological neurons, we introduce a small set of trainable spontaneous neurons that act as compensatory units to stabilize activations in sparsified LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that these auxiliary neurons substantially reduce the sparsification-induced performance gap while generalizing effectively across tasks."}

Rigorous evaluations show that it matches batch regression performance in static settings and consistently outperforms or rivals state-of-the-art online models, confirming its effectiveness. Concept drift datasets reveal a performance gap that OLR-WAA effectively bridges, setting it apart from other online models.

We introduce a model-agnostic framework that captures the interaction between resource allocation, concept drift dynamics, and deployment timing. We show that optimal training policies depend critically on the aging properties of concept durations. Under sudden concept changes, we derive optimal training policies subject to budget constraints when concept durations follow distributions with Decreasing Mean Residual Life (DMRL), and show that intuitive heuristics are provably suboptimal under Increasing Mean Residual Life (IMRL). We further study model deployment under communication constraints, prove that the associated optimization problem is quasi-convex under mild conditions, and propose a randomized scheduling strategy that achieves near-optimal client-side performance.

Through theoretical analysis on bimodal Gaussian mixtures, we demonstrate that the optimal velocity field exhibits jump discontinuities along decision boundaries, with magnitude approaching infinity as time approaches the target distribution. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon is not specific to $L^2$ loss, but rather may be a consequence of topological mismatch between distributions. We validate our theory empirically and discuss potential implications for flow matching on manifolds, connecting our findings to recent work on Riemannian flow matching and the challenge of learning discontinuous representations in neural networks."}

To counter this threat, we propose PRIVEE (PRIvacy-preserving Vertical fEderated lEarning), a novel defense mechanism named after the French word privée, meaning \"private.\" PRIVEE obfuscates confidence scores while preserving critical properties such as relative ranking and inter-score distances. Rather than exposing raw scores, PRIVEE shares only the transformed representations, mitigating the risk of reconstruction attacks without degrading model prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show that PRIVEE achieves a threefold improvement in privacy protection compared to state-of-the-art defenses, while preserving full predictive performance against advanced feature inference attacks."}

Conformal prediction provides distribution-free coverage guarantees but often produces overly large prediction sets, limiting its practical utility. To address this issue, we propose \\textit{Selective Conformal Risk Control} (SCRC), a unified framework that integrates conformal prediction with selective classification. The framework formulates uncertainty control as a two-stage problem: the first stage selects confident samples for prediction, and the second stage applies conformal risk control on the selected subset to construct calibrated prediction sets. We develop two algorithms under this framework. The first, SCRC-T, preserves exchangeability by computing thresholds jointly over calibration and test samples, offering exact finite-sample guarantees. The second, SCRC-I, is a calibration-only variant that provides PAC-style probabilistic guarantees while being more computational efficient. Experiments on two public datasets show that both methods achieve the target coverage and risk levels, with nearly identical performance, while SCRC-I exhibits slightly more conservative risk control but superior computational practicality. Our results demonstrate that selective conformal risk control offers an effective and efficient path toward compact, reliable uncertainty quantification."}

Yet LLMs often exhibit variability when prompts are phrased with minor differences, even when semantically equivalent. Such inconsistency undermines trust, complicates compliance, and disrupts user experience. While personalization is desirable in certain contexts, many enterprise scenarios-such as HR onboarding, customer support, or policy disclosure-require invariant information delivery regardless of phrasing or prior conversational history. Existing approaches, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and temperature tuning, improve factuality or reduce stochasticity but cannot guarantee stability across equivalent prompts. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly optimize for consistency. Unlike prior applications of GRPO, which have been limited to reasoning and code generation, we adapt GRPO to enforce stability of information content across groups of semantically equivalent prompts. We introduce entropy-based helpfulness and stability rewards, treating prompt variants as groups and resetting conversational context to isolate phrasing effects. Experiments on investment and job recommendation tasks show that our GRPO-trained model reduces variability more effectively than fine-tuning or decoding-based baselines. To our knowledge, this is a novel application of GRPO for aligning LLMs toward information consistency, reframing variability not as an acceptable feature of generative diversity but as a correctable flaw in enterprise deployments."}

AL provides a framework that helps practitioners query informative samples for annotation by oracles (labelers). However, these labels often contain noise due to varying levels of labeler accuracy. Additionally, uncertain samples are more prone to receiving incorrect labels because of their complexity. Learning from imperfectly labeled data leads to an inaccurate classifier. We propose a novel AL framework to construct a robust classification model by minimizing noise levels. Our approach includes an assignment model that optimally assigns query points to labelers, aiming to minimize the maximum possible noise within each cycle. Additionally, we introduce a new sampling method to identify the best query points, reducing the impact of label noise on classifier performance.

Learning accurate switching dynamical system models can reveal how behavior is encoded in neural activity. Existing switching approaches have primarily focused on learning models from a single neural modality, either continuous Gaussian signals or discrete Poisson signals. However, multiple neural modalities are often recorded simultaneously to measure different spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, and all these modalities can encode behavior. Moreover, regime labels are typically unavailable in training data, posing a significant challenge for learning models of regime-dependent switching dynamics. To address these challenges, we develop a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the parameters of switching multiscale dynamical system models using only multiscale neural observations. We demonstrate our method using both simulations and two distinct experimental datasets with multimodal spike-LFP observations during different motor tasks. We find that our switching multiscale dynamical system models more accurately decode behavior than switching single-scale dynamical models, showing the success of multiscale neural fusion. Further, our models outperform stationary multiscale models, illustrating the importance of tracking regime-dependent non-stationarity in multimodal neural data. The developed unsupervised learning framework enables more accurate modeling of complex multiscale neural dynamics by leveraging information in multimodal recordings while incorporating regime switches. This approach holds promise for improving the performance and robustness of brain-computer interfaces over time and for advancing our understanding of the neural basis of behavior."}

We propose a simple and principled distillation alternative based on \\emph{conditional distribution matching}. Our key observation is that the reverse conditional distribution of clean data given a noisy state, $p_{0\\mid t}(x_0 \\mid x_t)$, admits a Markov decomposition through intermediate times and can be recovered from marginal density ratios and the known forward CTMC kernel.

Why Do Reasoning Models Loop?", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) generate long chains of thought to solve harder problems, but they often loop, repeating the same text at low temperatures or with greedy decoding. We study why this happens and what role temperature plays. With open reasoning models, we find that looping is common at low temperature. Larger models tend to loop less, and distilled students loop significantly even when their teachers rarely do. This points to mismatches between the training distribution and the learned model, which we refer to as errors in learning, as a key cause. To understand how such errors cause loops, we introduce a synthetic graph reasoning task and demonstrate two mechanisms. First, risk aversion caused by hardness of learning: when the correct progress-making action is hard to learn but an easy cyclic action is available, the model puts relatively more probability on the cyclic action and gets stuck. Second, even when there is no hardness, Transformers show an inductive bias toward temporally correlated errors, so the same few actions keep being chosen and loops appear. Higher temperature reduces looping by promoting exploration, but it does not fix the errors in learning, so generations remain much longer than necessary at high temperature; in this sense, temperature is a stopgap rather than a holistic solution. We end with a discussion of training-time interventions aimed at directly reducing errors in learning."}

The current state of the scenario is assumed to be known from sensors and the prediction is taking into account various hypotheses about the behavior of traffic participants. This way, the uncertainties regarding the behavior of traffic participants can be modelled in detail. In the first part of this paper a model-based approach is presented to compute Predicted-Occupancy Grids (POG), which are introduced as a grid-based probabilistic representation of the future scenario hypotheses. However, due to the large number of possible trajectories for each traffic participant, the model-based approach comes with a very high computational load. Thus, a machine-learning approach is adopted for the computation of POGs. This work uses a novel grid-based representation of the current state of the traffic scenario and performs the mapping to POGs. This representation consists of augmented cells in an occupancy grid. The adopted machine-learning approach is based on the Random Forest algorithm. Simulations of traffic scenarios are performed to compare the machine-learning with the model-based approach. The results are promising and could enable the real-time computation of POGs for vehicle safety applications. With this detailed modelling of uncertainties, crucial components in vehicle safety systems like criticality estimation and trajectory planning can be improved."}

To further enhance efficiency, Hierarchical Group Quantization (HGQ) combines coarse-grained floating-point scaling with fine-grained shifting, effectively reducing dequantization cost. Also, SVD-guided mixed precision (SVD-MP) statically allocates higher bitwidths to precision-sensitive components identified through low-rank decomposition, thereby minimizing floating-point operation cost.

However, such models often rely on millions to billions of training sequences and billions of parameters, resulting in prohibitive computational costs and significant barriers to reproducibility and accessibility, particularly for academic labs. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of data pruning for BioFM pretraining and propose a post-hoc influence-guided data pruning framework tailored to biological domains. Our approach introduces a subset-based self-influence formulation that enables efficient estimation of sample importance at low computational cost, and builds upon it two simple yet effective selection strategies, namely Top-k Influence (Top I) and Coverage-Centric Influence (CCI). We empirically validate our method on two representative BioFMs, RNA-FM and ESM-C. For RNA, our framework consistently outperforms random selection baselines under an extreme pruning rate of over 99 percent, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our framework on protein-related tasks using ESM-C. In particular, our coreset even outperforms random subsets that are ten times larger in both RNA and protein settings, revealing substantial redundancy in biological sequence datasets. These findings underscore the potential of influence-guided data pruning to substantially reduce the computational cost of BioFM pretraining, paving the way for more efficient, accessible, and sustainable biological AI research."}

We present a diagnostic study using the Amazon Computers co-purchase data to understand when and why GCNs help. Through systematic experiments with simulated label scarcity, feature ablation, and per-class analysis, we find that GCN performance depends critically on the interaction between graph homophily and feature quality. GCNs provide the largest gains under extreme label scarcity, where they leverage neighborhood structure to compensate for limited supervision. Surprisingly, GCNs can match their original performance even when node features are replaced with random noise, suggesting that structure alone carries sufficient signal on highly homophilous graphs. However, GCNs hurt performance when homophily is low and features are already strong, as noisy neighbors corrupt good predictions. Our quadrant analysis reveals that GCNs help in three of four conditions and only hurt when low homophily meets strong features. These findings offer practical guidance for practitioners deciding whether to adopt graph-based methods."}

This reliance adds engineering complexity and hyperparameter tuning, while also lacking a direct data-driven gradient signal, which might result in sub-optimal compression. In this paper, we introduce CoDeQ, a simple, fully differentiable method for joint pruning--quantization. Our approach builds on a key observation: the dead-zone of a scalar quantizer is equivalent to magnitude pruning, and can be used to induce sparsity directly within the quantization operator. Concretely, we parameterize the dead-zone width and learn it via backpropagation, alongside the quantization parameters. This design provides explicit control of sparsity, regularized by a single global hyperparameter, while decoupling sparsity selection from bit-width selection. The result is a method for Compression with Dead-zone Quantizer (CoDeQ) that supports both fixed-precision and mixed-precision quantization (controlled by an optional second hyperparameter). It simultaneously determines the sparsity pattern and quantization parameters in a single end-to-end optimization. Consequently, CoDeQ does not require any auxiliary procedures, making the method architecture-agnostic and straightforward to implement. On ImageNet with ResNet-18, CoDeQ reduces bit operations to ~5% while maintaining close to full precision accuracy in both fixed and mixed-precision regimes."}

However, MMDI relies on the Helmholtz equation, which assumes wave propagation in a uniform, homogeneous, and infinite medium. Furthermore, the use of the Laplacian operator makes MMDI highly sensitive to noise, which compromises the accuracy and reliability of stiffness estimates. In this study, we propose the Deep-Learning driven Inversion Framework for Shear Modulus Estimation in MRE (DIME), aimed at enhancing the robustness of inversion. DIME is trained on the displacement fields-stiffness maps pair generated through Finite Element Modelling (FEM) simulations. To capture local wave behavior and improve robustness to global image variations, DIME is trained on small image patches. We first validated DIME using homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets simulated with FEM, where DIME produced stiffness maps with low inter-pixel variability, accurate boundary delineation, and higher correlation with ground truth (GT) compared to MMDI. Next, DIME was evaluated in a realistic anatomy-informed simulated liver dataset with known GT and compared directly to MMDI. DIME reproduced ground-truth stiffness patterns with high fidelity (r = 0.99, R^2 = 0.98), while MMDI showed greater underestimation. After validating DIME on synthetic data, we tested the model in in vivo liver MRE data from eight healthy and seven fibrotic subjects. DIME preserved physiologically consistent stiffness patterns and closely matched MMDI, which showed directional bias. Overall, DIME showed higher correlation with ground truth and visually similar stiffness patterns, whereas MMDI displayed a larger bias that can potentially be attributed to directional filtering. These preliminary results highlight the feasibility of DIME for clinical applications in MRE."}

Large Language Models (LLMs), in contrast, can produce human-readable explanations and facilitate feature analysis, potentially reducing the manual workload of fraud analysts and informing system refinements. However, they perform poorly when applied directly to tabular fraud detection due to the difficulty of reasoning over many features, the extreme class imbalance, and the absence of contextual information. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinFRE-RAG, a two-stage approach that applies importance-guided feature reduction to serialize a compact subset of numeric/categorical attributes into natural language and performs retrieval-augmented in-context learning over label-aware, instance-level exemplars. Across four public fraud datasets and three families of open-weight LLMs, FinFRE-RAG substantially improves F1/MCC over direct prompting and is competitive with strong tabular baselines in several settings. Although these LLMs still lag behind specialized classifiers, they narrow the performance gap and provide interpretable rationales, highlighting their value as assistive tools in fraud analysis."}

The framework formalizes the ETL scheduling process as a Markov Decision Process and enables adaptive decision-making by a reinforcement learning agent in high-dimensional state spaces to dynamically optimize task allocation and resource scheduling. The model consists of a state representation module, a feature embedding network, a Q-value estimator, and a reward evaluation mechanism, which collectively consider task dependencies, node load states, and data flow characteristics to derive the optimal scheduling strategy in complex environments. A multi-objective reward function is designed to balance key performance indicators such as average scheduling delay, task completion rate, throughput, and resource utilization. Sensitivity experiments further verify the model's robustness under changes in hyperparameters, environmental dynamics, and data scale. Experimental results show that the proposed deep Q-learning scheduling framework significantly reduces scheduling delay, improves system throughput, and enhances execution stability under multi-source heterogeneous task conditions, demonstrating the strong potential of reinforcement learning in complex data scheduling and resource management, and providing an efficient and scalable optimization strategy for intelligent data pipeline construction."}

Addressing this challenge, this work presents a multi-fidelity deep learning framework that combines autoencoder-based transfer learning with a newly developed Multi-Split Conformal Prediction (MSCP) strategy to achieve uncertainty-aware aerodynamic data fusion under extreme data scarcity. The methodology leverages abundant Low-Fidelity (LF) data to learn a compact latent physics representation, which acts as a frozen knowledge base for a decoder that is subsequently fine-tuned using scarce HF samples. Tested on surface-pressure distributions for NACA airfoils (2D) and a transonic wing (3D) databases, the model successfully corrects LF deviations and achieves high-accuracy pressure predictions using minimal HF training data. Furthermore, the MSCP framework produces robust, actionable uncertainty bands with pointwise coverage exceeding 95%.

Existing LLM personalization benchmarks are largely centered on two axes: accurately recalling user information and accurately applying remembered information in downstream tasks. We argue that a third axis, likability, is both subjective and central to user experience, yet under-measured by current benchmarks. To measure likability holistically, we introduce LikeBench, a multi-session, dynamic evaluation framework that measures likability across multiple dimensions by how much an LLM can adapt over time to a user's preferences to provide more likable responses. In LikeBench, the LLMs engage in conversation with a simulated user and learn preferences only from the ongoing dialogue. As the interaction unfolds, models try to adapt to responses, and after each turn, they are evaluated for likability across seven dimensions by the same simulated user. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to decompose likability into multiple diagnostic metrics: emotional adaptation, formality matching, knowledge adaptation, reference understanding, conversation length fit, humor fit, and callback, which makes it easier to pinpoint where a model falls short. To make the simulated user more realistic and discriminative, LikeBench uses fine-grained, psychologically grounded descriptive personas rather than the coarse high/low trait rating based personas used in prior work. Our benchmark shows that strong memory performance does not guarantee high likability: DeepSeek R1, with lower memory accuracy (86%, 17 facts/profile), outperformed Qwen3 by 28% on likability score despite Qwen3's higher memory accuracy (93%, 43 facts/profile). Even SOTA models like GPT-5 adapt well in short exchanges but show only limited robustness in longer, noisier interactions."}

To alleviate this problem, recent work has explored unsupervised RLVR methods that derive rewards solely from the model's internal consistency, such as through entropy and majority voting. While seemingly promising, these methods often suffer from model collapse in the later stages of training, which may arise from the reinforcement of incorrect reasoning patterns in the absence of external supervision. In this work, we investigate a novel semi-supervised RLVR paradigm that utilizes a small labeled set to guide RLVR training on unlabeled samples. Our key insight is that supervised rewards are essential for stabilizing consistency-based training on unlabeled samples, ensuring that only reasoning patterns verified on labeled instances are incorporated into RL training. Technically, we propose an effective policy optimization algorithm, TraPO, that identifies reliable unlabeled samples by matching their learning trajectory similarity to labeled ones. Building on this, TraPO achieves remarkable data efficiency and strong generalization on six widely used mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24/25, AMC, MATH-500, Minerva, and Olympiad) and three out-of-distribution tasks (ARC-c, GPQA-diamond, and MMLU-pro). With only 1K labeled and 3K unlabeled samples, TraPO reaches 42.6% average accuracy, surpassing the best unsupervised method trained on 45K unlabeled samples (38.3%).

However, transferring knowledge effectively from one graph to another remains a critical challenge. This highlights the need for algorithms capable of applying information extracted from a source graph to an unlabeled target graph, a task known as unsupervised graph domain adaptation (GDA). One key difficulty in unsupervised GDA is conditional shift, which hinders transferability. In this paper, we show that conditional shift can be observed only if there exists local dependencies among node features. To support this claim, we perform a rigorous analysis and also further provide generalization bounds of GDA when dependent node features are modeled using markov chains. Guided by the theoretical findings, we propose to improve GDA by decorrelating node features, which can be specifically implemented through decorrelated GCN layers and graph transformer layers.

However, SAC is notoriously difficult to combine with n-step returns, since their usual combination introduces bias in off-policy algorithms due to the changes in action distribution. While this problem is solved by importance sampling, a method for estimating expected values of one distribution using samples from another distribution, importance sampling may result in numerical instability. In this work, we combine SAC with n-step returns in a way that overcomes this issue. We present an approach to applying numerically stable importance sampling with simplified hyperparameter selection.

This ensemble-based encoding is independent of chemical detail, compatible with any molecular representation and illustrated here in the homopolymer case using a minimal language model.

We introduce a novel deep learning architecture, WAY, designed to process these reformulated trajectories for long-term destination estimation days to weeks in advance.

The representation layer generates multi-channel vector sequences from kinematic and non-kinematic features. CASP blocks utilize multi-headed channel- and self-attention for aggregation and sequential information delivery.

Experiments on 5-year AIS data demonstrate WAY's superiority over conventional spatial grid-based approaches regardless of trajectory progression. Results further confirm that adopting GD leads to performance gains. Finally, we explore WAY's potential for real-world application through multitask learning for ETA estimation."}

Deep learning enables high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts that can surpass traditional numerical models, while FL allows institutions in different locations to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, addressing efficiency and security concerns. While FL has shown promise across heterogeneous regions, its distributed nature introduces new vulnerabilities. In particular, data poisoning attacks, in which compromised clients inject manipulated training data, can degrade performance or introduce systematic biases. These threats are amplified by spatial dependencies in meteorological data, allowing localized perturbations to influence broader regions through global model aggregation. In this study, we investigate how adversarial clients distort federated surface temperature forecasts trained on the Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis (CERRA) dataset. We simulate geographically distributed clients and evaluate patch-based and global biasing attacks on regional temperature forecasts. Our results show that even a small fraction of poisoned clients can mislead predictions across large, spatially connected areas. A global temperature bias attack from a single compromised client shifts predictions by up to -1.7 K, while coordinated patch attacks more than triple the mean squared error and produce persistent regional anomalies exceeding +3.5 K. Finally, we assess trimmed mean aggregation as a defense mechanism, showing that it successfully defends against global bias attacks (2-13\\% degradation) but fails against patch attacks (281-603\\% amplification), exposing limitations of outlier-based defenses for spatially correlated data."}

Our study focuses on masked feature reconstruction (MFR), a generative technique where a model learns to restore the raw features of masked nodes in a self-supervised manner. We observe that both MFR and graph contrastive learning (GCL) aim to maximize agreement between similar elements. Building on this observation, we reveal a novel theoretical insight: under specific conditions, the objectives of MFR and node-level GCL converge, despite their distinct operational mechanisms. This theoretical connection suggests these approaches are complementary rather than fundamentally different, prompting us to explore their integration to enhance self-supervised learning on graphs. Our research presents Contrastive Masked Feature Reconstruction (CORE), a novel graph self-supervised learning framework that integrates contrastive learning into MFR. Specifically, we form positive pairs exclusively between the original and reconstructed features of masked nodes, encouraging the encoder to prioritize contextual information over the node's own features. Additionally, we leverage the masked nodes themselves as negative samples, combining MFR's reconstructive power with GCL's discriminative ability to better capture intrinsic graph structures. Empirically, our proposed framework CORE significantly outperforms MFR across node and graph classification tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.

In this work, we consider a label weakening approach to generate robust retrieval models in the presence of label noise. Instead of enforcing a single, potentially erroneous label for each query document pair, we allow for a set of plausible labels derived from both the observed supervision and the model's confidence scores. We perform an extensive evaluation considering two retrieval models, one re-ranking model, considering four diverse ranking datasets.

A common solution is to use multi-task learning (MTL) to train a unified model on post-click data to estimate the conversion rate (CVR) for these diverse targets. In practice, CVR prediction often encounters missing conversion data as many advertisers submit only a subset of user conversion actions due to privacy or other constraints, making the labels of multi-task data incomplete. If the model is trained on all available samples where advertisers submit user conversion actions, it may struggle when deployed to serve a subset of advertisers targeting specific conversion actions, as the training and deployment data distributions are mismatched. While considerable MTL efforts have been made, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively train a unified model with the incomplete and skewed multi-label data. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML). We introduce an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to better utilize data with asymmetric multi-label data in training. However, the more relaxed masking in ADM is a double-edged sword: it provides additional training signals but also introduces noise due to skewed data. To address this, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction mechanism (HKE) to model the sample discrepancy within the target task tower. Finally, to maximize the utility of unlabeled samples, we incorporate ranking loss strategy to further enhance our model. The effectiveness of KAML has been demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on offline industry datasets and online A/B tests, which show significant performance improvements over existing MTL baselines."}

As large language models (LLMs) become widely used, managing risks arising from insufficient forgetting or utility loss is increasingly crucial. Current MU techniques lack effective mechanisms for evaluating and controlling these risks, hindering the selection of strategies that appropriately balance safety and utility, and raising trust concerns surrounding the \"right to be forgotten.\" To address these issues, we propose FROC, a unified framework with Risk-Optimized Control for machine unlearning in LLMs. FROC is built around a conformal-style risk-control formulation that expresses a user-specified risk budget on unlearning behavior. This probability-based constraint enables FROC to compare MU strategies, identify feasible operating regions, and guide hyperparameter selection according to desired trade-offs between forgetting sufficiency and utility preservation. To operationalize this constraint, FROC introduces a smoothly varying continuous risk model that aggregates forgetting deficiency and utility degradation into a single configuration-level score. Building on conformal risk analysis, FROC computes (1) the Conformal Unlearning Risk (CUR), a data-driven estimated value on the probability that forgotten samples continue to influence model predictions, and (2) risk-controlled configuration sets, which identify unlearning hyperparameters that are valid under the specified risk budget. Experiments across multiple LLM MU methods demonstrate that FROC produces stable, interpretable risk landscapes and reveals consistent relationships between unlearning configurations, semantic shift, and utility impact. FROC reframes MU as a controllable, risk-aware process and offers a practical foundation for managing unlearning behavior in large-scale LLM deployments."}

However, the inference accuracy deteriorates due to the non-stationarity in the IoT environment and limited initial training data. To counteract this, the deployed models can be updated occasionally with new observed data samples. However, this approach consumes additional energy, which is undesirable for energy constrained IoT devices. This letter introduces an event-driven communication framework that strategically integrates continual learning (CL) in IoT networks for energy-efficient fault detection. Our framework enables the IoT device and the edge server (ES) to collaboratively update the lightweight ML model by adapting to the wireless link conditions for communication and the available energy budget. Evaluation on real-world datasets show that the proposed approach can outperform both periodic sampling and non-adaptive CL in terms of inference recall; our proposed approach achieves up to a 42.8% improvement, even under tight energy and bandwidth constraint."}

In this work, we introduce DPUL, a novel server-side unlearning method that deeply unlearns all influential weights to prevent privacy pitfalls. Our approach comprises three components: (i) identifying high-weight parameters by filtering client update magnitudes, and rolling them back to ensure deep removal. (ii) leveraging the variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct and eliminate low-weight parameters. (iii) utilizing a projection-based technique to recover the model.

Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition has demonstrated significant potential in practical applications due to its suitability across diverse people. However, most studies on cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition neglect the presence of inter-individual variability and negative transfer phenomena during model training. To address this issue, a cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition through source selection with adversarial strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed method comprises two modules: the source selection network (SS) and the adversarial strategies network (AS). The SS uses domain labels to reverse-engineer the training process of domain adaptation. Its key idea is to disrupt class separability and magnify inter-domain differences, thereby raising the classification difficulty and forcing the model to learn domain-invariant yet emotion-relevant representations. The AS gets the source domain selection results and the pretrained domain discriminators from SS. The pretrained domain discriminators compute a novel loss aimed at enhancing the performance of domain classification during adversarial training, ensuring the balance of adversarial strategies. This paper provides theoretical insights into the proposed method and achieves outstanding performance on two EEG-based emotion datasets, SEED and SEED-IV.

We introduce a new statistical primitive, the reproducibility budget $C_T$, which quantifies a system's finite capacity for statistical reproducibility - the extent to which its sampling process can remain governed by a consistent underlying distribution in the presence of both exogenous change and endogenous feedback. Formally, $C_T$ is defined as the cumulative Fisher-Rao path length of the coupled learner-environment evolution, measuring the total distributional motion accumulated during learning. From this construct we derive a drift-feedback generalization bound of order $O(T^{-1/2} + C_T/T)$, and we prove a matching minimax lower bound showing that this rate is minimax-optimal. Consequently, the results establish a reproducibility speed limit: no algorithm can achieve smaller worst-case generalization error than that imposed by the average Fisher-Rao drift rate $C_T/T$ of the data-generating process.

Unlike synchronous monitoring, this approach does not impose runtime latency, while still attempting to disrupt attacks before irreversible harm occurs. We treat monitor development as an adversarial game between a blue team (who design monitors) and a red team (who create sabotaging agents).

To ground this game in a realistic, high-stakes deployment scenario, we develop a suite of 5 diverse software engineering environments that simulate tasks that an agent might perform within an AI developer's internal infrastructure. Over the course of the game, we develop an ensemble monitor that achieves a 6% false negative rate at 1% false positive rate on a held out test environment.

This challenges interpretability, yet we lack principled methods to measure superposition. We present an information-theoretic framework measuring a neural representation's effective degrees of freedom. We apply Shannon entropy to sparse autoencoder activations to compute the number of effective features as the minimum neurons needed for interference-free encoding. Equivalently, this measures how many \"virtual neurons\" the network simulates through superposition. When networks encode more effective features than actual neurons, they must accept interference as the price of compression. Our metric strongly correlates with ground truth in toy models, detects minimal superposition in algorithmic tasks, and reveals systematic reduction under dropout. Layer-wise patterns mirror intrinsic dimensionality studies on Pythia-70M. The metric also captures developmental dynamics, detecting sharp feature consolidation during grokking. Surprisingly, adversarial training can increase effective features while improving robustness, contradicting the hypothesis that superposition causes vulnerability. Instead, the effect depends on task complexity and network capacity: simple tasks with ample capacity allow feature expansion (abundance regime), while complex tasks or limited capacity force reduction (scarcity regime). By defining superposition as lossy compression, this work enables principled measurement of how neural networks organize information under computational constraints, connecting superposition to adversarial robustness."}

This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under adverse conditions. We adapted the MangoLeafDB dataset, generating MangoLeafDB-C with 19 types of artificial corruptions at five severity levels.

We present Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs) and Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) as hybrid quantum language models, reporting the first empirical demonstration of generative language modeling trained and evaluated end-to-end on real quantum hardware. Our architecture combines hardware-optimized parametric quantum circuits with a lightweight classical projection layer, utilizing a multi-sample SPSA strategy to efficiently train quantum parameters despite hardware noise. To characterize the capabilities of these models, we introduce a synthetic dataset designed to isolate syntactic dependencies in a controlled, low-resource environment. Experiments on IBM Quantum processors reveal the critical trade-offs between circuit depth and trainability, demonstrating that while noise remains a significant factor, observable-based readout enables the successful learning of sequential patterns on NISQ devices. These results establish a rigorous engineering baseline for generative quantum natural language processing, validating the feasibility of training complex sequence models on current quantum hardware."}
