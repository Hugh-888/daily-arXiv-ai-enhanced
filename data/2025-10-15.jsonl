To address these challenges,\nwe propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine\n(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier\nfeature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it\ndifficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find\nan alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we\nintegrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,\nso there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we\nassign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM\nnetwork to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,\nwe develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these\nhyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM\nnot only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM\nframework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle\nhigh-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten\nnumerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed\nGFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,\nirregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the\nGFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without\nadditional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results\nconfirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and\nvariable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may\nfurther inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)\nframeworks."}

Here we prove that feed-forward neural quantum states\nacting on $n$ spins with $k$ scalar nonlinearities, under certain analyticity\nassumptions, obey a bound on entanglement entropy for any subregion: $S \\leq c\nk\\log n$, for a constant $c$. This establishes an NQS analog of the area law\nconstraint for matrix product states and rules out volume law entanglement for\nNQS with $O(1)$ nonlinearities.

We\nrevisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four\nrepresentative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and\nD'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case\n$\\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation.\nWe compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter\ncan be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A\ncrucial role is played by the sign of the term $\\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in\nSchwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal\ncoupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier.

The literature\ntypically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the\nfirm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both\ninventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge\nlies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is\nunknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a\nspecific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of\nreinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.\nHowever, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the\napplicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process\n(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive\nmodeling assumptions.
