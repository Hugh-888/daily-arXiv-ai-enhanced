It is shown that they may not be so exotic as usually expected. We show that NMOs appear as solutions of standard gravitational equations if we consider the system of a compact positive mass object, cosmological fluid and negative cosmological constant. We also construct models which generate such NMOs as solutions within the two-scalar theory and scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity inspired by string theory. The orbits of the photon and massive particles are investigated in the background, where there is a negative mass object which realises a kind of effective anti-gravity. It is explicitly found that the bound system consisting of a positive mass object and a negative mass object can be formed in spite that a positive mass object suffers the repulsive force from the NMO. The possibility that such exotic objects might be observed is discussed. A simple conjecture about their possible masses is made, too. As an even more exotic object, we consider a non-trivial object with vanishing mass and investigate its properties."}

The spacetimes considered are static, spherically symmetric, and nonsingular, and they include Bardeen-like, and Hayward-like regular black-hole limits as spacial cases. We characterize the horizon structure and thermodynamics properties, and we compute key optical observables by determining the photon-sphere location and the corresponding shadow size as seen by distant observers, including controlled perturbative limits and full numerical solutions. Using angular-size constraints for SgrA* and M87* from the Event Horizon Telescope and the GRAVITY collaboration, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to infer the admissible parameter ranges of the model and to quantify degeneracies among the black-hole mass and nonlinear-electrodynimcs parameters. On the quantum side, we develop the near-horizon reduction relevant for HBAR, showing that the dominant sector governing the detector response exhibits conformal behavior and leads to a thermal excitation spectrum governed by the horizon temperature. We formulate a Lindblad master-equation description of the radiation field, identify the thermal steady state, and derive an HBAR entropy-energy relation consistent with a Clausius-type first law. Finally, we establish a Wien-type displacement law for the HBAR spectrum, expressing the peak wavelength in terms of the horizon thermodynamics, thereby providing an additional observable link between nonlinear electrodynamics, regularity, and near-horizon quantum radiation."}

Our analysis emphasises the phenomenological implications of the model through a combination of analytical and numerical investigations, with particular attention to singularity resolution and the formation of trapped surfaces. As in symmetric bounce models, the central curvature singularity inside the collapsing dust cloud is resolved. However, in contrast to the symmetric case, we find that a singularity emerges in the polymerised vacuum region during the bounce phase. This singularity can be identified as a shell-crossing singularity and exhibits the expected power-law behaviour of curvature scalars. Furthermore, likewise to the symmetric bounce models, we find a critical mass threshold governing the formation of inner and outer horizons in the pre-bounce phase. No analogous critical mass restriction arises for the formation of the inner horizon in the post-bounce phase, highlighting a qualitative difference between the pre- and post-bounce dynamics."}

To address this, Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are commonly used to enforce safety constraints while optimizing performance. However, existing methods often suffer from significant safety violations or require a high sample complexity to generate near-optimal policies. We address two settings: relaxed feasibility, where small violations are allowed, and strict feasibility, where no violation is allowed. We propose a model-based primal-dual algorithm that balances regret and bounded constraint violations, drawing on techniques from online RL and constrained optimization. For relaxed feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an $\\varepsilon$-optimal policy with $\\varepsilon$-bounded violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{SAH^3}{\\varepsilon^2}\\right)$ learning episodes, matching the lower bound for unconstrained MDPs.

Applying the new eigenvalue equation to the relative motion of a hydrogen atom together with the derived relativistic Hamiltonian to quantify the impact of finite proton mass to the fine structure, correction to the fine structure is obtained as a result of the entanglement of the relative motion and the center-of-mass motion, which can be used to verify the correctness of the proposed eigenvalue equation. Applying the equation to the measurement of electron double-slit interference, it is analyzed that the photon packets with Lorentzian spectral lineshape, the domain and state density of the sub-system, and the energy of the incident electron together determines the spontaneous emission rate of the incident electron. Photons generated in this process excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of the detector. Corresponding to any emitted or absorbed photon, the sub-system is found to be uniquely determined by maximizing the transition rate. This new principle is valid for atoms too.

Code verification of such methods is challenging due to the interaction between the spatial- and temporal-discretization errors, the statistical sampling noise, and the stochastic nature of the collision algorithm. In this paper, we introduce our code-verification approaches to apply the method of manufactured solutions to plasma dynamics, and we derive expected convergence rates for the different sources of discretization and statistical error. For the particles, we incorporate the method of manufactured solutions into the equations of motion. We manufacture the particle distribution function and inversely query the cumulative distribution function to obtain known particle positions and velocities at each time step. In doing so, we avoid modifying the particle weights, eliminating risks from potentially negative weights or modifications to weight-dependent collision algorithms. For the collision algorithm, we average independent outcomes at each time step and we derive a corresponding manufactured source term for the velocity change for each particle. By having known solutions for the particle positions and velocities, we are able to compute the error in these quantities directly instead of attempting to compute differences in distribution functions. These approaches are equally valid for particle-in-cell simulations with Monte Carlo collisions and direct simulation Monte Carlo simulations of neutral gas flows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in three dimensions for different couplings between the particles and field, with and without binary elastic collisions, and with and without coding errors."}

We show that such exact solutions split into two main subclasses that (after a suitable re-parametrization) can be interpreted as either the uncharged Schwarzschild or C-metric in the external Bertotti-Robinson (BR) spacetime with geometry ${\\mathrm{AdS}_2\\times\\mathrm{S}_2}$, or as the charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the external BR electromagnetic field. The distinction between these two subclasses is determined by the parameter $r_0$ that encodes relations between the external Maxwell field (given by the non-aligned components of the Faraday tensor ${Φ_0=Φ_2}$) and the Maxwell field created by the charge of the black hole (given by the aligned component $Φ_1$). Namely, if ${r_0=0}$ then the electromagnetic field is fully determined by ${Φ_0=Φ_2}$, and one gets the C-metric in the BR universe (including also the non-accelerating Schwarzschild-BR black hole). But if ${r_0\\neq 0}$ then the electromagnetic field is independently determined by both the external BR field and the field of a black hole itself, and this can be interpreted as the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. Even though such an interpretation of the spacetime family is quite simple, it contains a lot of subtleties (e.g. the no-charge limit of the RN-BR spacetime, the non-trivial dependence on the signs of the mass and charge of a black hole, extreme black holes, and others) which we carefully investigate in this work.

The construction is based on a doubling of degrees of freedom and independent of a foliation. The action naturally decomposes into a bulk term furnishing Einstein's equations and a boundary term, which is related to conserved quantities, such as the Komar mass.

We propose the Neural Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Neural-POD), a plug-and-play neural operator framework that constructs nonlinear, orthogonal basis functions in infinite-dimensional space using neural networks. Unlike the classical Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), which is limited to linear subspace approximations obtained through singular value decomposition (SVD), Neural-POD formulates basis construction as a sequence of residual minimization problems solved through neural network training. Each basis function is obtained by learning to represent the remaining structure in the data, following a process analogous to Gram--Schmidt orthogonalization. This neural formulation introduces several key advantages over classical POD: it enables optimization in arbitrary norms (e.g., $L^2$, $L^1$), learns mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces that is resolution-invariant, generalizes effectively to unseen parameter regimes, and inherently captures nonlinear structures in complex spatiotemporal systems. The resulting basis functions are interpretable, reusable, and enabling integration into both reduced order modeling (ROM) and operator learning frameworks such as deep operator learning (DeepONet). We demonstrate the robustness of Neural-POD with different complex spatiotemporal systems, including the Burgers' and Navier-Stokes equations.

These observables allow for a quantitative characterization of the quantum correlations present in a top quark--antiquark system, thus enabling an interpretation of collider data in terms of quantum states and their properties. Discord is observed to be greater than zero with a significance of more than 5 standard deviations ($σ$). Evidence for steering is found with a significance of more than 3$σ$. This is the first evidence for steering, and the first observation of discord in a high-energy system. No Bell correlation is observed within the currently probed phase space, in agreement with the theoretical prediction. These results experimentally corroborate the full hierarchy of quantum correlations in top quarks with discord being the most basic form of quantum correlation, followed by entanglement, steering and Bell correlation.

These conditions restrict the curvature in such a way that the spacetime becomes conformally flat and belongs to the family of embedding class-I solutions. Even though the subsequent solutions namely, the Schwarzschild interior solution and the de Sitter solution are well known, the novelty of our presentation is that these solutions are shown to be a direct consequence of the imposed geometric constraints. The physical matter composition becomes highly constrained by the associated geometry under such conditions. The Schwarzschild interior solution describes the spacetime of an incompressible fluid sphere while the de Sitter solution corresponds to a vacuum energy dominated configuration. Interestingly, pressure anisotropy as well as `complexity factor' vanish identically once the Karmarkar's condition and the conformal flatness conditions are applied simultaneously. As these two geometric constraints alone are sufficient to determine the background spacetime uniquely, Karmarkar's condition might not be a suitable method for the development of realistic stellar models in a conformally flat spacetime unless one invokes other factors into consideration such as time-dependent metric potentials."}

We propose the Augmented-Intrinsic Dual-Masked Autoencoder (AID-MAE), which learns directly from incomplete time series by applying an intrinsic missing mask to represent naturally missing values and an augmented mask that hides a subset of observed values for reconstruction during training. AID-MAE processes only the unmasked subset of tokens and consistently outperforms strong baselines, including XGBoost and DuETT, across multiple clinical tasks on two datasets.

To investigate this effect, we build a controlled synthetic retrieval task and find that a transformer trained only on text achieves perfect in-distribution accuracy but fails to generalize out of distribution, while subsequent training on an image-tokenized version of the same task nearly doubles text-only OOD performance. Mechanistic interpretability reveals that visual training changes the model's internal binding strategy: text-only training encourages positional shortcuts, whereas image-based training disrupts them through spatial translation invariance, forcing the model to adopt a more robust symbolic binding mechanism that persists even after text-only examples are reintroduced. We further characterize how binding strategies vary across training regimes, visual encoders, and initializations, and show that analogous shifts occur during pretrained LLM-to-VLM transitions. Our findings suggest that cross-modal training can enhance reasoning and generalization even for tasks grounded in a single modality."}

In this paper, we propose a high-dimensional superdense coding protocol using energy-time entangled states. These states are biphoton frequency combs, an example of entangled time-frequency Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (TFGKP) states or time-frequency grid states. Inspired by GKP codes, our protocol involves discretizing the continuous time and frequency degrees of freedom and encoding information by time-frequency displacements. This approach leverages the inherently large Hilbert space found in quantum frequency combs, with resilience against both temporal and spectral errors. In addition to describing the theoretical structure of the protocol, we propose an experimental implementation using standard telecommunication components, time-resolving single-photon detectors and a frequency beamsplitter. We also analyze the effect of experimental noise and errors on the channel capacity of the protocol. We demonstrate that for realistic experimental parameters, contemporary technologies satisfy the prerequisites for superdense coding with biphoton frequency combs, achieving a transmission rate of approximately 8.91 bits per transmitted photon (equivalent to 481 distinguishable messages with asymptotically vanishing errors). This more than doubles the previously highest transmission rate of 4 bits achieved by the Kwiat-Weinfurter scheme, while also having competitive optical loss. Furthermore, our results beat the rate achievable using a single-photon frequency comb with identical parameters by 4.6 times. Our protocol thus represents an experimentally feasible application of time-frequency grid states to entanglement-assisted communication, contributing to the active fields of continuous-variable and high-dimensional quantum information."}

Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schrödinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $ζ$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum.

COMPOT employs orthogonal dictionaries that enable closed-form Procrustes updates for the dictionary and analytical single-step sparse coding for the coefficients, eliminating iterative optimization. To handle heterogeneous layer sensitivity under a global compression budget, COMPOT further introduces a one-shot dynamic allocation strategy that adaptively redistributes layer-wise compression rates.

We address this challenge by formulating reward learning from multiple feedback types as Bayesian inference over a shared latent reward function, where each feedback type contributes information through an explicit likelihood. We introduce a scalable amortized variational inference approach that learns a shared reward encoder and feedback-specific likelihood decoders and is trained by optimizing a single evidence lower bound. Our approach avoids reducing feedback to a common intermediate representation and eliminates the need for manual loss balancing. Across discrete and continuous-control benchmarks, we show that jointly inferred reward posteriors outperform single-type baselines, exploit complementary information across feedback types, and yield policies that are more robust to environment perturbations.

Building on the framework introduced in Gunn et al., Phys. Rev. B 111, 115110 (2025), we extend the analysis from abelian and class-2 nilpotent groups to all finite nilpotent groups. For any such symmetry group $G$, we construct explicit protocols composed of $G$-symmetric circuits and measurements with feedforward that transform symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states into the trivial phase and vice versa using a finite number of measurement rounds determined by the nilpotency class of $G$. Although these transformations are approximate, we prove that their success probability converges to unity in the thermodynamic limit, establishing asymptotically deterministic equivalence. Consequently, all SPT phases protected by finite nilpotent groups collapse to a single phase once symmetric measurements and feedforward are allowed. We further show that the same holds for non-normal MPS with long-range correlations, including GHZ-type states. The central technical ingredient is a hierarchical structure of irreducible representations of nilpotent groups, which enables a recursive reduction of non-abelian components to abelian ones.

A further challenge is the performance interference that can arise from joint multilingual training, commonly referred to as the \"curse of multilinguality\". We study multilingual data curation across thirteen languages and find that many reported regressions are not inherent to multilingual scaling but instead stem from correctable deficiencies in data quality and composition rather than fundamental capacity limits. In controlled bilingual experiments, improving data quality for any single language benefits others: curating English improves non-English performance in 12 of 13 languages, while curating non-English yields reciprocal improvements in English. Bespoke per-language curation produces substantially larger within-language improvements. Extending these findings to large-scale general-purpose training mixtures, we show that curated multilingual allocations comprising under 8% of total tokens remain remarkably effective. We operationalize this approach within an effort that produced a 20T-token pretraining corpus derived entirely from public sources. Models with 3B and 8B parameters trained on a 1T-token random subset achieve competitive multilingual accuracy with 4-10x fewer training FLOPs than strong public baselines, establishing a new Pareto frontier in multilingual performance versus compute. Moreover, these benefits extend to frontier model scale: the 20T-token corpus served as part of the pretraining dataset for Trinity Large (400B/A13B), which exhibits strong multilingual performance relative to its training FLOPs.

However, our analyses indicate that such representations can be insensitive to fine-grained binding interactions and may rely on shortcut correlations in training data, limiting their ability to rank ligands by true binding compatibility. To address these issues, we propose BindCLIP, a unified contrastive-generative representation learning framework for virtual screening. BindCLIP jointly trains pocket and ligand encoders using CLIP-style contrastive learning together with a pocket-conditioned diffusion objective for binding pose generation, so that pose-level supervision directly shapes the retrieval embedding space toward interaction-relevant features. To further mitigate shortcut reliance, we introduce hard-negative augmentation and a ligand-ligand anchoring regularizer that prevents representation collapse. Experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. BindCLIP achieves substantial gains on challenging out-of-distribution virtual screening and improves ligand-analogue ranking on the FEP+ benchmark. Together, these results indicate that integrating generative, pose-level supervision with contrastive learning yields more interaction-aware embeddings and improves generalization in realistic screening settings, bringing virtual screening closer to real-world applicability."}

The highly nondegenerate pairs are 700 nm apart: one in the 1500 nm E- and S-band telecommunication range and the other in the 830 nm NIR range. The high non-degeneracy means the photon pairs are far-detuned from Raman noise, resulting in a high coincidence-to-accidental ratio even while operating at room temperature. The source produces two spectrally and spatially distinct phase-matched processes with low spectral cross-talk, distinct transverse spatial modes in the NIR, and a single fundamental spatial mode in the telecommunication range. The source's room-temperature operation, off-the-shelf materials, and multiplexing potential make it promising for deployment in quantum networks."}

However, despite significant progress, models remain vulnerable to simple in-distribution exploits, such as rewriting prompts in the past tense or translating them into other languages. We argue that this persistent fragility stems from a fundamental limitation in current adversarial training algorithms: they minimize adversarial loss on their training set but inadequately cover the data distribution, resulting in vulnerability to seemingly simple attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose Distributional Adversarial Training, DAT. We leverage Diffusion LLMs to approximate the true joint distribution of prompts and responses, enabling generation of diverse, high-likelihood samples that address generalization failures. By combining optimization over the data distribution provided by the diffusion model with continuous adversarial training, DAT achieves substantially higher adversarial robustness than previous methods."}

Our results demonstrate that both the charging energy and ergotropy of the quantum batteries can be significantly enhanced within the ultra-strong coupling regime and across a broader temperature range in transient time. A unidirectional energy flow is achieved by controlling the system's initial state through its two-mode squeezed ground state. Furthermore, we show that the steady-state stored energy, along with its corresponding ergotropy, can be enhanced at larger temperatures and stronger coupling strengths. Notably, a purely beam-splitter or two-mode squeezing interaction yields zero ergotropy. These findings indicate that the enhanced stored energy and ergotropy of the quantum battery arises principally from the combined effects of beam-splitter and parametric amplification (squeezing) couplings. In addition, the presence of the squared electromagnetic vector potential term can prevent a phase transition and achieve a significant charging energy and high ergotropy in the deep-strong coupling regime. The results presented herein enhance our understanding of the operating principles of open bosonic quantum batteries."}

We complement our theory with extensive experiments on standard graph benchmarks, demonstrating that GTs exhibit scalable behavior on par with GNNs. To further show the efficiency in a real-world scenario, we implement GTs for shortest path distance estimation over terrains to better illustrate the efficiency of the transferable GTs. Our results provide new insights into the understanding of GTs and suggest practical directions for efficient training of GTs in large-scale settings."}

We present the first systematic study of scaling behaviour for masked-reconstruction transformers trained on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Using expression profiles from the CELLxGENE Census, we construct two experimental regimes: a data-rich regime (512 highly variable genes, 200,000 cells) and a data-limited regime (1,024 genes, 10,000 cells). Across seven model sizes spanning three orders of magnitude in parameter count (533 to 3.4 x 10^8 parameters), we fit the parametric scaling law to validation mean squared error (MSE). The data-rich regime exhibits clear power-law scaling with an irreducible loss floor of c ~ 1.44, while the data-limited regime shows negligible scaling, indicating that model capacity is not the binding constraint when data are scarce. These results establish that scaling laws analogous to those observed in natural language processing do emerge in single-cell transcriptomics when sufficient data are available, and they identify the data-to-parameter ratio as a critical determinant of scaling behaviour. A preliminary conversion of the data-rich asymptotic floor to information-theoretic units yields an estimate of approximately 2.30 bits of entropy per masked gene position.

The explicit form of the double elementary braiding matrices (DEBMs) in these models are derived from the F-matrices and R-symbols obtained via the q-deformed representation theory of SU(2). Using these EBMs, standard single-qubit gates are synthesized up to a global phase by a Genetic Algorithm-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev Algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA), achieving the accuracy required for fault-tolerant quantum computation with only 2-level decomposition. For two-qubit entangling gates, Genetic Algorithm (GA) yields braidwords of 30 braiding operations that approximate the local equivalence class [CNOT]. Theoretically, we demonstrate that performing double-braiding in a three-anyon (six-anyon) encoding of single-qubit (two-qubit) is topologically equivalent to a protocol requiring the physical manipulation of only one (three) anyons to execute arbitrary braids. Our numerical results provide strong evidence that double-braiding in SU(2)k anyons models is capable of universal quantum computation. Moreover, the proposed protocol offers a potential new strategy for significantly reducing the number of non-Abelian anyons that need to be physically manipulated in future braiding-based topological quantum computations (TQC)."}

However, OPD requires expensive on-the-fly sampling of the student policy during training, which substantially increases training cost, especially for long responses. Our initial analysis shows that, during OPD, training signals are often concentrated in the prefix of each output, and that even a short teacher-generated prefix can significantly help the student produce the correct answer. Motivated by these observations, we propose a simple yet effective modification of OPD: we apply the distillation objective only to prefixes of student-generated outputs and terminate each sampling early during distillation. Experiments on a suite of AI-for-Math and out-of-domain benchmarks show that on-policy prefix distillation matches the performance of full OPD while reducing training FLOP by 2x-47x."}

We propose a quantum-inspired classification head architecture that projects backbone features into a complex-valued Hilbert space and evolves them under a learned unitary transformation parameterised via the Cayley map. Through a controlled hybrid experimental design - training a single shared backbone and comparing lightweight interchangeable heads - we isolate the effect of complex-valued unitary representations on calibration. Our ablation study on CIFAR-10 reveals that the unitary magnitude head (complex features evolved under a Cayley unitary, read out via magnitude and softmax) achieves an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.0146, representing a 2.4x improvement over a standard softmax head (0.0355) and a 3.5x improvement over temperature scaling (0.0510). Surprisingly, replacing the softmax readout with a Born rule measurement layer - the quantum-mechanically motivated approach - degrades calibration to an ECE of 0.0819. On the CIFAR-10H human-uncertainty benchmark, the wave function head achieves the lowest KL-divergence (0.336) to human soft labels among all compared methods, indicating that complex-valued representations better capture the structure of human perceptual ambiguity. We provide theoretical analysis connecting norm-preserving unitary dynamics to calibration through feature-space geometry, report negative results on out-of-distribution detection and sentiment analysis to delineate the method's scope, and discuss practical implications for safety-critical applications.

A key finding is that continuous coupling, unlike discrete coupling at finite points, breaks the constant phase difference condition, thereby weakening the interference effects in giant atom-waveguide systems. In addition, a key technical advantage of the SSE approach is that auto- and cross-correlation functions can directly reflect the complex photon emission/absorption processes and time-delay effects in giant atom-waveguide systems. Moreover, the SSE approach also naturally handles multiple excitations, without increasing equation complexity as the number of excitations grows. This feature enables the investigation of multi-excitation initial states of the waveguide, such as thermal and squeezed initial states. Overall, our approach provides a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of giant atoms coupled to waveguide, particularly for continuous coupling and multi-excitation systems."}

Our focus is on the role of information geometry on semantic encoding and the linear representation hypothesis. As an illustrative application, we develop \"dual steering\", a method for robustly steering representations to exhibit a particular concept using linear probes. We prove that dual steering optimally modifies the target concept while minimizing changes to off-target concepts.

To be specific, we derive the dynamical equations of an optomechanical system and demonstrate that the non-linearity (cause of chaos) in the equations arises entirely from the time-domain convolutions (TDCs) induced by non-Markovian corrections. Under Markovian conditions, these TDCs are reduced into constants, thereby losing the nonlinearity and ultimately leading to the disappearance of chaos. Furthermore, we also observe chaos generation in the absence of optomechanical couplings, which further confirms that the non-Markovian effect is the sole inducement of chaos and the environmental parameters play important roles in the generation of chaos. We hope these results may open a new direction to investigate chaotic dynamics purely caused by non-Markovian environments."}

We present a hybrid privacy-preserving framework that combines Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) to support decision-oriented healthcare modeling without raw-data sharing. The approach keeps feature-extraction trunks on clients while hosting prediction heads on a coordinating server, enabling shared representation learning and exposing an explicit collaboration boundary where privacy controls can be applied. Rather than assuming distributed training is inherently private, we audit leakage empirically using membership inference on cut-layer representations and study lightweight defenses based on activation clipping and additive Gaussian noise. We evaluate across three public clinical datasets under non-IID client partitions using a unified pipeline and assess performance jointly along four deployment-relevant axes: factual predictive utility, uplift-based ranking under capacity constraints, audited privacy leakage, and communication overhead. Results show that hybrid FL-SL variants achieve competitive predictive performance and decision-facing prioritization behavior relative to standalone FL or SL, while providing a tunable privacy-utility trade-off that can reduce audited leakage without requiring raw-data sharing. Overall, the work positions hybrid FL-SL as a practical design space for privacy-preserving healthcare decision support where utility, leakage risk, and deployment cost must be balanced explicitly."}

The mechanism of the environment induced cat state transfer is analyzed both analytically and numerically to demonstrate that the transfer is a unique phenomenon in non-Markovian regime. From this example, the non-Markovian environment is shown to be qualitatively different from the Markovian environment reflected by the finite versus zero residue coherence. Besides, we also show the influence of environmental parameters are crucial for the transfer.

Our results reveal striking differences between state exclusion and the more familiar task of state discrimination. In particular, we show that LOCC antidistinguishability of multipartite product states is symmetric with respect to the initiating party but this symmetry breaks down for higher-order $x$-antidistinguishability. Most notably, we establish a manifestation of \\emph{nonlocality without entanglement} in the context of state exclusion: we prove that three bipartite product states can be globally antidistinguishable while failing to be LOCC antidistinguishable, demonstrating that three is the minimal number of states required for this phenomenon. We further extend this separation to $2$-antidistinguishability and present example exhibiting the same type of nonlocality.

We validate the temporal reliability by fitting on earlier model generations and evaluating on later releases. Across various tasks, the estimated boundaries are mostly stable, with the exception of math reasoning that exhibits a consistently advancing boundary over time.

Here, we show that an extended cluster-Ising model, despite belonging to the above category, exhibits super-extensive charging power over wide ranges of system sizes, reaching up to a thousand spins, in proper parameter regimes. This remarkable anomalous scaling is due to a corresponding super-extensive growth of the stored energy, implying that it occurs at large but finite size and cannot persist in the thermodynamic limit.

Existing resampling and reweighting strategies often disrupt inter-label dependencies or require brittle hyperparameter tuning, especially as the label space expands to tens of thousands of labels. To address this issue, we propose Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label Learning (CD-GTMLL), a scalable cooperative framework that recasts long-tail MLC as a multi-player game - each sub-predictor (\"player\") specializes in a partition of the label space, collaborating to maximize global accuracy while pursuing intrinsic curiosity rewards based on tail label rarity and inter-player disagreement. This mechanism adaptively injects learning signals into under-represented tail labels without manual balancing or tuning. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that our CD-GTMLL converges to a tail-aware equilibrium and formally links the optimization dynamics to improvements in the Rare-F1 metric. Extensive experiments across 7 benchmarks, including extreme multi-label classification datasets with 30,000+ labels, demonstrate that CD-GTMLL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with gains up to +1.6% P@3 on Wiki10-31K. Ablation studies further confirm the contributions of both game-theoretic cooperation and curiosity-driven exploration to robust tail performance.

Existing interpretability methods often highlight tokens or spans correlated with an answer, but they rarely reveal where the model makes consequential reasoning turns, which earlier context causally triggers those turns, or whether the highlighted text actually steers the reasoning process. We introduce Directional Reasoning Trajectory Change (DRTC), a process-causal framework for interpreting long-form reasoning from a single on-policy rollout. DRTC detects pivot decision points using uncertainty and distribution-shift signals, then applies receiver-side interventions that preserve the realized rollout without resampling the continuation while blocking information flow from selected earlier chunks only at a pivot. It measures whether each intervention redirects the direction of the model's log-probability trajectory relative to the realized rollout direction, producing a signed per-chunk attribution score. We also compute turning-angle curvature changes on raw logits as a complementary diagnostic and introduce curvature signatures to summarize shared intervention-response geometry. Empirically, directional influence is sharply concentrated across four reasoning models (per-example |DRTC| shares yield Gini 0.50 to 0.58 and top-5 percent mass 0.23 to 0.28), and learned pivots induce stronger intervention magnitudes than matched random spans. In a scaling study on 500 MATH problems with R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, learned spans outperform matched random spans (median delta = 0.409, 355 of 500 positive; sign test p = 2.3e-21). Overall, DRTC provides a causally grounded, trajectory-level view of how specific context elements steer reasoning under on-policy dynamics."}

We reformulate the optimization task as a graph-partitioning problem based on the independent sets (ISs) of a scheduling graph that encodes delivery incompatibilities. Each partition corresponds to deliveries assigned to a single drone, with the objective of minimizing the total number of partitions. While the ISs represent time-feasible schedules, battery-duration constraints are enforced through a classical post-processing routine. This methodology enables the recovery of optimal delivery schedules, provided a sufficient number of samples is collected from the QPU to resolve the solution space.

By not waiting for slower clients and executing the training process concurrently, it achieves faster training speed compared to traditional federated learning. However, due to the staleness introduced by the asynchronous process, its performance may degrade in some scenarios. Existing methods often use the round difference between the current model and the global model as the sole measure of staleness, which is coarse-grained and lacks observation of the model itself, thereby limiting the performance ceiling of asynchronous methods. In this paper, we propose FedPSA (Parameter Sensitivity-based Asynchronous Federated Learning), a more fine-grained AFL framework that leverages parameter sensitivity to measure model obsolescence and establishes a dynamic momentum queue to assess the current training phase in real time, thereby adjusting the tolerance for outdated information dynamically. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and comparisons with various methods demonstrate the superior performance of FedPSA, achieving up to 6.37\\% improvement over baseline methods and 1.93\\% over the current state-of-the-art method."}

We construct the set of free operations for general types of products by extending the local-operation-and-classical-communication paradigm, familiar from standard entanglement theory, thereby establishing a resource theory of correlations for general products. A generalization is provided beyond two factors that can be universally related to multipartite entanglement. Applications that highlight the usefulness of the approach are discussed, such as the factorization of fermionic states, the non-local factorization of multi-photon states into single-photon states, and the interesting possibility of understanding prime numbers as a form of single-party entanglement."}

To address these limitations, we introduce Obj-Disco, a framework that automatically decomposes an alignment reward signal into a sparse, weighted combination of human-interpretable natural language objectives. Our approach utilizes an iterative greedy algorithm to analyze behavioral changes across training checkpoints, identifying and validating candidate objectives that best explain the residual reward signal.

Across a range of non-IID partitioning schemes, FOFedAvg is competitive with, and often outperforms, these baselines in terms of test performance and convergence speed. On the theoretical side, we prove that FOFedAvg converges to a stationary point under standard smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions for fractional order $0<α\\le 1$.

We show that although a generalized two-alternative three-photon interference setup based on CPDC or TOPDC involves eight different length parameters, the interference can be fully characterized in terms of only three independent parameters. The first parameter is the three-photon path-length difference, which has a direct analog in the one-photon and two-photon cases, and the other two parameters quantify the path-asymmetry length. Unlike two-photon interference, which requires only one parameter to quantify path-asymmetry, two independent parameters are needed in three-photon interference. This results in a broader class of nonclassical three-photon effects, including three-photon HOM-type effects.

In particular, the role of the self-generated magnetic field arising from electron motion and the feasibility of coherent spin control without disrupting diffraction coherence have not been quantitatively investigated. In this article, a self-consistent Maxwell-Pauli framework is developed to study spin-resolved electron diffraction from nanogratings in the presence of magnetic fields. The model incorporates geometric confinement, image-charge interactions, self-generated magnetostatic fields, and externally applied magnetic fields. Numerical simulations show that the intrinsic magnetic self-field produced by the electron probability current is several orders of magnitude too weak to induce measurable spin mixing, demonstrating that nanogratings act as spin-conserving beam splitters under field-free conditions. When a uniform magnetic field is applied upstream of the nanograting, coherent Larmor precession enables controlled spin rotation without modifying the diffraction geometry or degrading coherence. The magnetic field required for a $π$ spin rotation scales inversely with the interaction length and electron de Broglie wavelength $λ_{dB}$. Furthermore, a downstream nonuniform magnetic field applied after the nanograting imparts a spatially varying Zeeman phase, producing opposite transverse momentum shifts for the two spin components. The spin-dependent transverse dynamics is analyzed using Husimi Q-function phase-space maps, which visualize spin-dependent population redistribution and momentum separation. The proposed approach enables tunable spatial separation of spin-resolved free electron beams and establishes an all-magnetic route for coherent spin rotation, control, and interferometry."}

This coupled formulation enables mutual guidance, where the enhancing signal refines the class estimation and, conversely, the evolving class logits guide the signal reconstruction towards discriminative regions of the manifold.

In this work, we introduce asymmetric variants of well-known SSD environments and examine how natural differences between agents influence cooperation dynamics. Our findings reveal that existing fairness-based methods struggle to adapt under asymmetric conditions by enforcing raw equality that wrongfully incentivize defection. To address this, we propose three modifications: (i) redefining fairness by accounting for agents' reward ranges, (ii) introducing an agent-based weighting mechanism to better handle inherent asymmetries, and (iii) localizing social feedback to make the methods effective under partial observability without requiring global information sharing.

(2025) that closeness in KL divergence need not imply high linear representational similarity, we study a distributional distance based on logit differences and show that closeness in this distance does yield linear similarity guarantees. Specifically, we define a representational dissimilarity measure based on the models' identifiability class and prove that it is bounded by the logit distance. We further show that, when model probabilities are bounded away from zero, KL divergence upper-bounds logit distance; yet the resulting bound fails to provide nontrivial control in practice. As a consequence, KL-based distillation can match a teacher's predictions while failing to preserve linear representational properties, such as linear-probe recoverability of human-interpretable concepts.

The protocol also informs design choices: on SWaT under log drift, replacing normalizing flows with Gaussian density reduces high-stress F1 from ~0.75 to ~0.57, and fixing a learned DAG gives a small clean-set gain (~0.5-1.0 points) but increases drift sensitivity by ~8x."}

However, the generalization of reasoning models is still vaguely defined and poorly understood. In this work, we present an evaluation framework to rigorously examine how well chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches generalize on a simple planning task. Specifically, we consider a grid-based navigation task in which a model is provided with a map and must output a sequence of moves that guides a player from a start position to a goal while avoiding obstacles. The versatility of the task and its data allows us to fine-tune model variants using different input representations (visual and textual) and CoT reasoning strategies, and systematically evaluate them under both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test conditions. Our experiments show that, while CoT reasoning improves in-distribution generalization across all representations, out-of-distribution generalization (e.g., to larger maps) remains very limited in most cases when controlling for trivial matches with the ID data. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning traces which combine multiple text formats yield the best (and non-trivial) OOD generalization. Finally, purely text-based models consistently outperform those utilizing image-based inputs, including a recently proposed approach relying on latent space reasoning."}

We introduce a tensor-based parametrization where the diagonal entries of these states are encoded as a symmetric tensor, enabling a direct translation between entanglement properties and well-studied convex cones of tensors. Our results bridge multipartite entanglement theory with semialgebraic geometry and the theory of completely positive and copositive tensors. This dictionary maps separability to completely positive tensors, the PPT property to moment tensors, entanglement witnesses to copositive tensors, and decomposable witnesses to sum of squares tensors. Using this framework, we construct explicit PPT entangled states in three or more qutrits. In this class of states, we establish that PPT entanglement exists for all multipartite systems with three qutrits or more, disproving a recent conjecture in [J. Math. Phys. 66, 022203 (2025)]. We also show that, for mixtures of Dicke states, the PPT condition with respect to the most balanced bipartition implies PPT with respect to any other bipartition. We further connect bosonic extendibility of mixtures of Dicke states to the duals of known hierarchies for non-negative polynomials, such as the ones by Reznick and Polya. We thus provide semidefinite programming relaxations for separability and entanglement testing in the Dicke subspace."}

Therefore, a number of methods varying in the tightness of their bounds and their computational cost have been developed to approximate the Lipschitz constant for different classes of networks. However, comparatively little research exists on methods for exact computation, which has been shown to be NP-hard. Nonetheless, there are applications where one might readily accept the computational cost of an exact method. These applications could include the benchmarking of new methods or the computation of robustness guarantees for small models on sensitive data. Unfortunately, existing exact algorithms restrict themselves to only ReLU-activated networks, which are known to come with severe downsides in the context of Lipschitz-constrained networks. We therefore propose a generalization of the LipBaB algorithm to compute exact Lipschitz constants for arbitrary piecewise linear neural networks and $p$-norms. With our method, networks may contain traditional activations like ReLU or LeakyReLU, activations like GroupSort or the related MinMax and FullSort, which have been of increasing interest in the context of Lipschitz constrained networks, or even other piecewise linear functions like MaxPool."}

In federated GNN settings, client graphs often exhibit heterogeneous structural and propagation characteristics. When standard aggregation mechanisms are applied to such heterogeneous updates, the global model may converge numerically while exhibiting degraded relational behavior.Our work identifies a geometric failure mode of global aggregation in Cross- Domain Federated GNNs. Although GNN parameters are numerically represented as vectors, they encode relational transformations that govern the direction, strength, and sensitivity of information flow across graph neighborhoods. Aggregating updates originating from incompatible propagation regimes can therefore introduce destructive interference in this transformation space.This leads to loss of coherence in global message passing. Importantly, this degradation is not necessarily reflected in conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy.To address this issue, we propose GGRS (Global Geometric Reference Structure), a server-side framework that regulates client updates prior to aggregation based on geometric admissibility criteria. GGRS preserves directional consistency of relational transformations as well as maintains diversity of admissible propagation subspaces. It also stabilizes sensitivity to neighborhood interactions, without accessing client data or graph topology. Experiments on heterogeneous GNN-native, Amazon Co-purchase datasets demonstrate that GGRS preserves global message-passing coherence across training rounds by highlighting the necessity of geometry-aware regulation in federated graph learning."}

However, such training risks models learning to obfuscate their deception to evade the detector. Prior work has studied obfuscation only in artificial settings where models were directly rewarded for harmful output. We construct a realistic coding environment where reward hacking via hardcoding test cases naturally occurs, and show that obfuscation emerges in this setting. We introduce a taxonomy of possible outcomes when training against a deception detector. The model either remains honest, or becomes deceptive via two possible obfuscation strategies. (i) Obfuscated activations: the model outputs deceptive text while modifying its internal representations to no longer trigger the detector. (ii) Obfuscated policy: the model outputs deceptive text that evades the detector, typically by including a justification for the reward hack. Empirically, obfuscated activations arise from representation drift during RL, with or without a detector penalty. The probe penalty only incentivizes obfuscated policies; we theoretically show this is expected for policy gradient methods. Sufficiently high KL regularization and detector penalty can yield honest policies, establishing white-box deception detectors as viable training signals for tasks prone to reward hacking."}

We propose direct Kolen-Pollack predictive coding (DKP-PC), which simultaneously addresses both feedback delay and exponential decay, yielding a more efficient and scalable variant of PC while preserving update locality. Leveraging direct feedback alignment and direct Kolen-Pollack algorithms, DKP-PC introduces learnable feedback connections from the output layer to all hidden layers, establishing a direct pathway for error transmission. This yields an algorithm that reduces the theoretical error propagation time complexity from O(L), with L being the network depth, to O(1), removing depth-dependent delay in error signals.

To address this question, we here develop a unified mean-field theory for RNNs and DNNs in terms of representational kernels, describing fully trained networks in the feature learning ($μ$P) regime. This theory casts training as Bayesian inference over sequences and patterns, directly revealing the functional implications induced by the RNNs' weight sharing. In DNN-typical tasks, we identify a phase transition when the learning signal overcomes the noise due to randomness in the weights: below this threshold, RNNs and DNNs behave identically; above it, only RNNs develop correlated representations across timesteps. For sequential tasks, the RNNs' weight sharing furthermore induces an inductive bias that aids generalization by interpolating unsupervised time steps. Overall, our theory offers a way to connect architectural structure to functional biases."}

Existing works cannot be directly applied as they either focus on sample space coverage or multi-objective optimization that targets the Pareto front. However, chemically diverse samples often yield identical objective profiles, and safety constraints are usually defined on the objectives. To solve this MOC problem, we propose a novel search algorithm, MOC-CAS, which employs an upper confidence bound-based acquisition function to select optimistic samples guided by Gaussian process posterior predictions. For enabling efficient optimization, we develop a smoothed relaxation of the hard feasibility test and derive an approximate optimizer.

To alleviate this conflict, we propose an optimization-based unsupervised learning approach based on the wireless transformer (WiT) architecture that learns from channel state information (CSI) features. We reformulate the trade-off by combining the sum rate and fairness objectives through a Lagrangian multiplier, which is updated automatically via a dual-ascent algorithm. This mechanism allows for a controllable fairness constraint while simultaneously maximizing the sum rate, effectively realizing a trace on the Pareto front between two conflicting objectives. Our findings show that the proposed approach offers a flexible solution for managing the trade-off optimization under prescribed fairness."}

We re-frame this problem of representational collapse from a \\emph{bifurcation theory} perspective, characterizing oversmoothing as convergence to a stable ``homogeneous fixed point.'' Our central contribution is the theoretical discovery that this undesired stability can be broken by replacing standard monotone activations (e.g., ReLU) with a class of functions. Using Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, we analytically prove that this substitution induces a bifurcation that destabilizes the homogeneous state and creates a new pair of stable, non-homogeneous \\emph{patterns} that provably resist oversmoothing.

We formalize this bias and propose a \\emph{Stratified Stress-Test} that partitions evaluation into Stationary and Transient regimes. Using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) as a testbed -- chosen for its rigorous ground-truth forcing functions (meals, insulin) that enable precise regime identification -- we establish three findings with broad implications:(i)~Stationary Efficiency: Linear interpolation achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction during stable intervals, confirming that complex architectures are computationally wasteful in low-entropy regimes.(ii)~Transient Fidelity: During critical transients (post-prandial peaks, hypoglycemic events), linear methods exhibit drastically degraded morphological fidelity (DTW), disproportionate to their RMSE -- a phenomenon we term the \\emph{RMSE Mirage}, where low pointwise error masks the destruction of signal shape.(iii)~Regime-Conditional Model Selection: Deep learning models preserve both pointwise accuracy and morphological integrity during transients, making them essential for safety-critical downstream tasks. We further derive empirical missingness distributions from clinical trials and impose them on complete training data, preventing models from exploiting unrealistically clean observations and encouraging robustness under real-world missingness.

The forward direction, i.e., computing output quantities from design parameters, typically requires running a numerical simulation, such as a FEM, as an intermediate step, which is an optimization problem by itself. In many scenarios, several design parameters can lead to the same or similar output values. For such cases, multi-modal probabilistic approaches are advantageous to obtain diverse solutions. A major difficulty in inverse design stems from the structure of the design space, since discrete parameters or further constraints disallow the direct use of gradient-based optimization. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel inverse design method based on diffusion models. Our approach relaxes the original design space into a continuous grid representation, where gradients can be computed by implicit differentiation in the forward simulation. A diffusion model is trained on this relaxed parameter space in order to serve as a prior for plausible relaxed designs. Parameters are sampled by guided diffusion using gradients that are propagated from an objective function specified at inference time through the differentiable simulation. A design sample is obtained by backprojection into the original parameter space. We develop our approach for a composite material design problem where the forward process is modeled as a linear FEM problem. We evaluate the performance of our approach in finding designs that match a specified bulk modulus. We demonstrate that our method can propose diverse designs within 1% relative error margin from medium to high target bulk moduli in 2D and 3D settings. We also demonstrate that the material density of generated samples can be minimized simultaneously by using a multi-objective loss function."}

Piecewise-linear (PL), ReLU-based RNNs (PLRNNs) have a strong track-record in this regard, representing SOTA DSR models while allowing mathematical insight by virtue of their PL design.

In this work, we propose to use a second-order discrete gradient method embedded in the learning of dynamical systems with port-Hamiltonian neural networks. Numerical results are provided for three systems deliberately selected to span different ranges of dynamical behavior under control: a baseline harmonic oscillator with quadratic energy storage; a Duffing oscillator, with a non-quadratic Hamiltonian offering amplitude-dependent effects; and a self-sustained oscillator, which can stabilize in a controlled limit cycle through the incorporation of a nonlinear dissipation. We show how the use of this discrete gradient method outperforms the performance of a Runge-Kutta method of the same order. Experiments are also carried out to compare two theoretically equivalent port-Hamiltonian systems formulations and to analyze the impact of regularizing the Jacobian of port-Hamiltonian neural networks during training."}

Inspired by random feature methods for kernel approximation in Euclidean spaces, we introduce randomized spectral node embeddings whose dot products estimate a low-rank approximation of any specific graph kernel.

Given the paramount importance of early diagnosis, recent studies have increasingly focused on computer-aided diagnostic models to enhance precision and reliability.

To overcome these limitations, the Meta-Relational Copula-Based Graph Attention Network (MRC-GAT) is proposed as an efficient multimodal model for AD classification tasks. The proposed architecture, copula-based similarity alignment, relational attention, and node fusion are integrated as the core components of episodic meta-learning, such that the multimodal features, including risk factors (RF), Cognitive test scores, and MRI attributes, are first aligned via a copula-based transformation in a common statistical space and then combined by a multi-relational attention mechanism. According to evaluations performed on the TADPOLE and NACC datasets, the MRC-GAT model achieved accuracies of 96.87% and 92.31%, respectively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared to existing diagnostic models.

We aim to generalize urban representation learning beyond city- and task-specific settings, towards a foundation-style model for urban analytics. To this end, we propose UrbanVerse, a model for cross-city urban representation learning and cross-task urban analytics. For cross-city generalization, UrbanVerse focuses on features local to the target regions and structural features of the nearby regions rather than the entire city. We model regions as nodes on a graph, which enables a random walk-based procedure to form \"sequences of regions\" that reflect both local and neighborhood structural features for urban region representation learning. For cross-task generalization, we propose a cross-task learning module named HCondDiffCT. This module integrates region-conditioned prior knowledge and task-conditioned semantics into the diffusion process to jointly model multiple downstream urban prediction tasks. HCondDiffCT is generic. It can also be integrated with existing urban representation learning models to enhance their downstream task effectiveness. Experiments on real-world datasets show that UrbanVerse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across six tasks under cross-city settings, achieving up to 35.89% improvements in prediction accuracy."}

However, this objective creates an imbalance, where some users receive far too many matches while many others receive very few and eventually abandon the platform. Retaining users is crucial for many platforms, such as those that depend heavily on subscriptions. Some may use fairness objectives to solve the problem of match maximization. However, fairness in itself is not the ultimate objective for many platforms, as users do not suddenly reward the platform simply because exposure is equalized. In practice, where user retention is often the ultimate goal, casually relying on fairness will leave the optimization of retention up to luck.\n  In this work, instead of maximizing matches or axiomatically defining fairness, we formally define the new problem setting of maximizing user retention in two-sided matching platforms. To this end, we introduce a dynamic learning-to-rank (LTR) algorithm called Matching for Retention (MRet). Unlike conventional algorithms for two-sided matching, our approach models user retention by learning personalized retention curves from each user's profile and interaction history. Based on these curves, MRet dynamically adapts recommendations by jointly considering the retention gains of both the user receiving recommendations and those who are being recommended, so that limited matching opportunities can be allocated where they most improve overall retention. Naturally but importantly, empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets from a major online dating platform show that MRet achieves higher user retention, since conventional methods optimize matches or fairness rather than retention."}

We show that the prevailing explanation, that fine-tuning updates should be orthogonal to safety-critical directions in high-dimensional parameter space, offers false reassurance: we show this orthogonality is structurally unstable and collapses under the dynamics of gradient descent. We then resolve this through a novel geometric analysis, proving that alignment concentrates in low-dimensional subspaces with sharp curvature, creating a brittle structure that first-order methods cannot detect or defend. While initial fine-tuning updates may indeed avoid these subspaces, the curvature of the fine-tuning loss generates second-order acceleration that systematically steers trajectories into alignment-sensitive regions. We formalize this mechanism through the Alignment Instability Condition, three geometric properties that, when jointly satisfied, lead to safety degradation. Our main result establishes a quartic scaling law: alignment loss grows with the fourth power of training time, governed by the sharpness of alignment geometry and the strength of curvature coupling between the fine-tuning task and safety-critical parameters. These results expose a structural blind spot in the current safety paradigm. The dominant approaches to safe fine-tuning address only the initial snapshot of a fundamentally dynamic problem. Alignment fragility is not a bug to be patched; it is an intrinsic geometric property of gradient descent on curved manifolds. Our results motivate the development of curvature-aware methods, and we hope will further enable a shift in alignment safety analysis from reactive red-teaming to predictive diagnostics for open-weight model deployment."}

This mismatch can result in policies that perform poorly on low-probability states that are still within the safe set. A natural alternative is to frame the problem as a robust optimization over a set of initial conditions that specify the initial state, dynamics and safe set, but whether this problem has a solution depends on the feasibility of the specified set, which is unknown a priori. We propose Feasibility-Guided Exploration (FGE), a method that simultaneously identifies a subset of feasible initial conditions under which a safe policy exists, and learns a policy to solve the reachability problem over this set of initial conditions. Empirical results demonstrate that FGE learns policies with over 50% more coverage than the best existing method for challenging initial conditions across tasks in the MuJoCo simulator and the Kinetix simulator with pixel observations."}

The SAH, however, lacks a precise definition, which has led to (i) different and seemingly orthogonal arguments supporting it, and (ii) important critiques to it. We propose a new metric called task complexity: the length of the shortest program that achieves a target performance on a task. In this framework, the SAH simply claims that pre-trained models drastically reduce the complexity of achieving high performance on many tasks. Our definition unifies prior arguments supporting the SAH, interpreting them as different strategies to find such short programs. Experimentally, we estimate the task complexity of mathematical reasoning, machine translation, and instruction following; we then show that these complexities can be remarkably low when conditioned on a pre-trained model. Further, we find that pre-training enables access to strong performances on our tasks, but it can require programs of gigabytes of length to access them. Post-training, on the other hand, collapses the complexity of reaching this same performance by several orders of magnitude. Overall, our results highlight that task adaptation often requires surprisingly little information -- often just a few kilobytes."}

Solving this task exactly is infeasible in general due to the exponential growth of the underlying combinatorial search space. Existing approaches suffer from misaligned optimization objectives, substantial training costs and limited generalization across different qubit counts. We mitigate these limitations by using supervised learning to approximate the minimum description length of residual unitaries and combining this estimate with stochastic beam search to identify near optimal gate sequences. Our method relies on a lightweight model with zero-shot generalization, substantially reducing training overhead compared to prior baselines. Across multiple benchmarks, we achieve faster wall-clock synthesis times while exceeding state-of-the-art methods in terms of success rate for complex circuits."}

We propose the Neural Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Neural-POD), a plug-and-play neural operator framework that constructs nonlinear, orthogonal basis functions in infinite-dimensional space using neural networks. Unlike the classical Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), which is limited to linear subspace approximations obtained through singular value decomposition (SVD), Neural-POD formulates basis construction as a sequence of residual minimization problems solved through neural network training. Each basis function is obtained by learning to represent the remaining structure in the data, following a process analogous to Gram--Schmidt orthogonalization. This neural formulation introduces several key advantages over classical POD: it enables optimization in arbitrary norms (e.g., $L^2$, $L^1$), learns mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces that is resolution-invariant, generalizes effectively to unseen parameter regimes, and inherently captures nonlinear structures in complex spatiotemporal systems. The resulting basis functions are interpretable, reusable, and enabling integration into both reduced order modeling (ROM) and operator learning frameworks such as deep operator learning (DeepONet). We demonstrate the robustness of Neural-POD with different complex spatiotemporal systems, including the Burgers' and Navier-Stokes equations. We further show that Neural-POD serves as a high performance, plug-and-play bridge between classical Galerkin projection and operator learning that enables consistent integration with both projection-based reduced order models and DeepONet frameworks."}
