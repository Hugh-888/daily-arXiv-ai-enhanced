This move deliberately sidesteps\nthe assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables. Our\nupdated version of the Reality Criterion works like this: if Alice measures\nobservable x and obtains outcome a, then Bob's system must adopt a conditional\nstate that ensures the corresponding outcome for that specific context.\nCrucially, we also assume operational completeness - a condition that quantum\nmechanics satisfies when we're dealing with quantum-reachable assemblages. Now,\nin any theory where one party cannot signal to the other (so-called one-sided\nno-signaling theories), perfect predictions do support drawing context-indexed\ninferences. But - and this is key - they don't legitimize assigning fixed\nvalues across all contexts. We rigorously demonstrate this distinction. To\nground the argument, we offer examples: the qubit singlet scenario using Pauli\nsettings and CJWR thresholds, a continuous-variable case based on the Reid\ncriteria, and a counterexample in the spirit of the PR box, which highlights\nthe boundaries of what quantum theory can actually reach."}

Recent works recovered\nanalogs of the Fundamental Theorem in the computable setting, for instance by\nintroducing an effective VC-dimension. Guided by this, we investigate the\nconnection between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER)\nclasses, whose members can be algorithmically listed. Our results show that the\neffective VC-dimensions can take arbitrary values above the traditional one,\neven for RER classes, which creates a whole family of (non-)examples for\nvarious notions of CPAC learning. Yet the two dimensions coincide for classes\nsatisfying sufficiently strong notions of CPAC learning. We then observe that\nCPAC learnability can also be characterized via containment of RER classes that\nrealize the same samples. Furthermore, it is shown that CPAC learnable classes\nsatisfying a unique identification property are necessarily RER. Finally, we\nestablish that agnostic learnability can be guaranteed for RER classes, by\nconsidering the relaxed notion of nonuniform CPAC learning."}

Second, when generalizing to\nnew satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in\nperformance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third,\nthe performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\\% when given\nadditional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the\nlast linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get\nrelatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the\nbenchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the\ndatasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing\nmodels with stronger cross-satellite generalization."}

We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to\nquantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model.\nGRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without\naccess to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an\ninformation-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of\ngradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the\ndistilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86%\nSpearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo\nstudents. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher\ncan improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the\nbest-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design\nchoices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when\ngenerating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size\nconstraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family.\nAltogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively\nidentify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide\nfine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation."}

Zhang", "Sarang Gopalakrishnan"], "title": "Stability of mixed-state phases under weak decoherence", "comment": "25 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "We prove that the Gibbs states of classical, and commuting-Pauli,\nHamiltonians are stable under weak local decoherence: i.e., we show that the\neffect of the decoherence can be locally reversed. In particular, our\nconclusions apply to finite-temperature equilibrium critical points and ordered\nlow-temperature phases. In these systems the unconditional spatio-temporal\ncorrelations are long-range, and local (e.g., Metropolis) dynamics exhibits\ncritical slowing down. Nevertheless, our results imply the existence of local\n\"decoders\" that undo the decoherence, when the decoherence strength is below a\ncritical value. An implication of these results is that thermally stable\nquantum memories have a threshold against decoherence that remains nonzero as\none approaches the critical temperature. Analogously, in diffusion models,\nstability of data distributions implies the existence of\ncomputationally-efficent local denoisers in the late-time generation dynamics."}
