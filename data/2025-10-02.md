### [1] [Direct Token Optimization: A Self-contained Approach to Large Language Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00125)
*Hong kyu Lee,Ruixuan Liu,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了直接令牌优化(DTO)方法，一种无需外部资源的自包含机器学习遗忘方法，通过区分目标令牌和非目标令牌来同时实现遗忘和保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM遗忘方法依赖辅助语言模型、保留数据集或商业AI服务，这在实际应用中不切实际且可能引入额外隐私风险，因此需要开发自包含的遗忘方法。

Method: 直接优化令牌级目标，将序列中的令牌分为目标令牌（用于优化遗忘目标）和非目标令牌（用于保持模型性能），无需外部资源。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，DTO相比最新基线方法在遗忘质量上提升了16.8倍，同时保持了可比较的模型性能水平。

Conclusion: DTO是一种有效的自包含LLM遗忘方法，能够在不依赖外部资源的情况下实现高质量的遗忘，同时保持模型效用。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a
subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with
applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model
correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely
forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall
utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often
utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI
services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,
dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could
potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct
token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs
that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for
external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of
tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the
remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model
utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the
latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show
that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality
on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a
comparable level of model utility.

### [2] [TAMA: Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent for Procedural Activity Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00161)
*Kimihiro Hasegawa,Wiradee Imrattanatrai,Masaki Asada,Ken Fukuda,Teruko Mitamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TAMA框架，一种工具增强的多模态代理，用于程序性活动理解，通过多媒体返回工具实现训练免费的多模态推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序性活动助手在日常生活和专业场景中具有广泛应用潜力，但针对此类助手的系统开发仍处于探索不足的状态。

Method: TAMA框架使用多媒体返回工具实现交错多模态推理，在训练免费设置下工作，具有灵活工具选择能力。

Result: 在ProMQA-Assembly数据集上的实验显示，该方法能提升视觉语言模型的性能，特别是GPT-5和MiMo-VL模型。消融研究证实了多媒体返回工具和灵活工具选择的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架和实验结果促进了视频和多模态任务的图像思维范式，推动了程序性活动助手的开发。

Abstract: Procedural activity assistants potentially support humans in a variety of
settings, from our daily lives, e.g., cooking or assembling flat-pack
furniture, to professional situations, e.g., manufacturing or biological
experiments. Despite its potential use cases, the system development tailored
for such an assistant is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, called TAMA, a Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent, for procedural
activity understanding. TAMA enables interleaved multimodal reasoning by making
use of multimedia-returning tools in a training-free setting. Our experimental
result on the multimodal procedural QA dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, shows that our
approach can improve the performance of vision-language models, especially
GPT-5 and MiMo-VL. Furthermore, our ablation studies provide empirical support
for the effectiveness of two features that characterize our framework,
multimedia-returning tools and agentic flexible tool selection. We believe our
proposed framework and experimental results facilitate the thinking with images
paradigm for video and multimodal tasks, let alone the development of
procedural activity assistants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRBench是一个用于评估AI代理在企业环境中处理复杂、开放式深度研究任务的基准测试，涵盖多步骤查询和异构搜索空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注简单问题或仅限网络查询，无法评估AI代理在企业环境中处理复杂深度研究任务的能力。

Method: 通过精心设计的合成流程生成任务，包含人工验证，评估代理从公共网络和私有知识库中识别相关事实的能力。

Result: 发布了涵盖10个领域的15个深度研究任务，评估了多种开源和闭源模型及策略，揭示了其优势和弱点。

Conclusion: DRBench为推进企业深度研究提供了关键路径，能够有效评估AI代理在复杂企业环境中的表现。

Abstract: We introduce DRBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex,
open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings. Unlike prior benchmarks
that focus on simple questions or web-only queries, DRBench evaluates agents on
multi-step queries (for example, ``What changes should we make to our product
roadmap to ensure compliance with this standard?") that require identifying
supporting facts from both the public web and private company knowledge base.
Each task is grounded in realistic user personas and enterprise context,
spanning a heterogeneous search space that includes productivity software,
cloud file systems, emails, chat conversations, and the open web. Tasks are
generated through a carefully designed synthesis pipeline with
human-in-the-loop verification, and agents are evaluated on their ability to
recall relevant insights, maintain factual accuracy, and produce coherent,
well-structured reports. We release 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains,
such as Sales, Cybersecurity, and Compliance. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of DRBench by evaluating diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source
models (such as GPT, Llama, and Qwen) and DR strategies, highlighting their
strengths, weaknesses, and the critical path for advancing enterprise deep
research. Code is available at https://github.com/ServiceNow/drbench.

### [4] [PrimeX: A Dataset of Worldview, Opinion, and Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00174)
*Rik Koncel-Kedziorski,Brihi Joshi,Tim Paek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrimeX是一个包含858名美国居民公共意见调查数据的数据集，额外收集了受访者的书面解释和世界观调查信息，用于研究如何利用个人信念系统来改进语言模型的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型的广泛应用，需要更好地将个体用户信息表示给模型。研究探索是否可以利用个体的信念系统来改善语言模型的对齐效果。

Method: 开发PrimeX数据集，包含公共意见调查数据、受访者的书面解释以及世界观调查信息，并进行广泛的数据分析。

Result: 研究表明信念解释和世界观信息对于个性化语言模型具有价值，PrimeX中的额外信念信息能够同时有益于NLP和心理学研究社区。

Conclusion: PrimeX数据集为利用个人信念系统改进语言模型对齐开辟了新的研究途径，展示了信念信息在个性化建模中的潜力。

Abstract: As the adoption of language models advances, so does the need to better
represent individual users to the model. Are there aspects of an individual's
belief system that a language model can utilize for improved alignment?
Following prior research, we investigate this question in the domain of opinion
prediction by developing PrimeX, a dataset of public opinion survey data from
858 US residents with two additional sources of belief information: written
explanations from the respondents for why they hold specific opinions, and the
Primal World Belief survey for assessing respondent worldview. We provide an
extensive initial analysis of our data and show the value of belief
explanations and worldview for personalizing language models. Our results
demonstrate how the additional belief information in PrimeX can benefit both
the NLP and psychological research communities, opening up avenues for further
study.

### [5] [Personalized Reasoning: Just-In-Time Personalization and Why LLMs Fail At It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00177)
*Shuyue Stella Li,Avinandan Bose,Faeze Brahman,Simon Shaolei Du,Pang Wei Koh,Maryam Fazel,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREFDISCO是一个评估框架，将静态基准转化为个性化推理任务，揭示了当前LLMs在个性化推理方面的局限性，29%的个性化尝试比通用回答更差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM开发将任务解决和偏好对齐分开处理，但在需要即时个性化的人类交互场景中，正确解决问题不足以满足用户需求，特别是在冷启动或隐私限制下。

Method: 引入PREFDISCO评估方法，使用基于心理学的角色和稀疏偏好，将静态基准转化为交互式个性化任务，创建相同问题需要不同推理链的场景。

Result: 评估21个前沿模型在10个任务上的表现，发现29.0%的个性化尝试比通用回答更差，而通用回答也无法有效满足个体用户需求。

Conclusion: 个性化推理需要专门开发而非自然涌现，PREFDISCO建立了可衡量的研究前沿，揭示了当前LLMs交互能力的根本限制。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) development treats task-solving and
preference alignment as separate challenges, optimizing first for objective
correctness, then for alignment to aggregated human preferences. This paradigm
fails in human-facing applications where solving a problem correctly is
insufficient if the response mismatches the user's needs. This challenge
intensifies in just-in-time scenarios where no prior user interaction history
exists due to cold-start conditions or privacy constraints. LLMs need to
identify what they don't know about user preferences, strategically elicit
preference values through questioning, then adapt their reasoning processes and
responses accordingly -- a complicated chain of cognitive processes which we
term personalized reasoning. We introduce PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology
that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using
psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences. Our framework
creates scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains
depending on user context, as optimal explanation approaches vary by individual
expertise and preferences while maintaining factual accuracy. Evaluation of 21
frontier models across 10 tasks reveals 29.0% of naive personalization attempts
produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet generic
responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively. These findings
suggest personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than
emerging naturally. PREFDISCO establishes personalized reasoning as a
measurable research frontier and reveals fundamental limitations in current
LLMs' interactive capabilities, providing a foundation for developing systems
that can adapt to individual users in education, healthcare, and technical
domains where personalization is critical.

### [6] [BiasFreeBench: a Benchmark for Mitigating Bias in Large Language Model Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00232)
*Xin Xu,Xunzhi He,Churan Zhi,Ruizhe Chen,Julian McAuley,Zexue He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了BiasFreeBench基准，统一评估8种主流偏见缓解方法，引入Bias-Free Score响应级指标，系统比较提示与训练范式、模型大小等维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见缓解方法评估存在基线不统一、指标不一致的问题，且大多基于概率比较而非真实用户交互场景，需要建立一致的评估框架。

Method: 构建BiasFreeBench基准，重组现有数据集为统一查询-响应设置，在多项选择QA和开放式多轮QA两种场景下评估8种偏见缓解方法。

Result: 系统比较了提示与训练范式的差异，分析了模型大小和训练策略对未见偏见类型的泛化能力影响。

Conclusion: BiasFreeBench为偏见缓解研究提供了统一的测试平台，有助于推动该领域的标准化发展。

Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs)
use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to
inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly
based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased
contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use
cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair
and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent
evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce
BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight
mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four
training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended
multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response
setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to
measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and
anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and
analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model
size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types.
We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed
for bias mitigation research.

### [7] [TASER: Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00255)
*Monishwaran Maheswaran,Marco Carini,Christian Federmann,Tony Diaz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TASER是一个基于大型推理模型的翻译质量评估指标，通过系统化逐步推理进行翻译评估，在WMT24指标共享任务中表现出最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动翻译评估指标缺乏可解释性和透明度，需要开发结合准确性和透明度的评估方法。

Method: 利用大型推理模型的显式推理能力，采用结构化提示模板进行系统化、逐步的翻译质量评估，并测试不同推理深度对评估质量的影响。

Result: 在系统级评估中，TASER在基于参考和无参考设置下均获得最高的软配对准确率；在段落级评估中，无参考变体在所有无参考方法中排名第一。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在翻译质量评估方面显示出可衡量的进步，结合了改进的准确性和跨语言对的透明评估。

Abstract: We introduce TASER (Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and
Reasoning), a metric that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) for automated
translation quality assessment. TASER harnesses the explicit reasoning
capabilities of LRMs to conduct systematic, step-by-step evaluation of
translation quality. We evaluate TASER on the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task across
both reference-based and reference-free scenarios, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance. In system-level evaluation, TASER achieves the
highest soft pairwise accuracy in both reference-based and reference-free
settings, outperforming all existing metrics. At the segment level, TASER
maintains competitive performance with our reference-free variant ranking as
the top-performing metric among all reference-free approaches. Our experiments
reveal that structured prompting templates yield superior results with LRMs
compared to the open-ended approaches that proved optimal for traditional LLMs.
We evaluate o3, a large reasoning model from OpenAI, with varying reasoning
efforts, providing insights into the relationship between reasoning depth and
evaluation quality. The explicit reasoning process in LRMs offers
interpretability and visibility, addressing a key limitation of existing
automated metrics. Our results demonstrate that Large Reasoning Models show a
measurable advancement in translation quality assessment, combining improved
accuracy with transparent evaluation across diverse language pairs.

### [8] [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Electrocardiogram-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00261)
*Xiaoyu Song,William Han,Tony Chen,Chaojing Duan,Michael A. Rosenberg,Emerson Liu,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于心电图-语言模型(ELMs)的开源检索增强生成(RAG)管道，通过实验证明RAG能持续提升ELMs在自然语言生成任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管检索增强生成(RAG)在大语言模型中广泛应用以减少幻觉并改善自然语言生成，但目前缺乏针对心电图-语言模型(ELMs)的开源RAG实现和系统研究。

Method: 开发了首个ELMs的RAG开源管道，包含基线模型和自然语言生成的消融研究，在三个公共数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，使用RAG的ELMs相比非RAG基线模型在性能上持续提升，并突出了关键的ELM设计考虑因素。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了ELMs领域RAG实现的空白，证明了RAG在提升心电图-语言模型性能方面的有效性，并提供了开源实现供社区使用。

Abstract: Interest in generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs) is growing,
as they can produce textual responses conditioned on ECG signals and textual
queries. Unlike traditional classifiers that output label probabilities, ELMs
are more versatile, supporting domain-specific tasks (e.g., waveform analysis,
diagnosis, prognosis) as well as general tasks (e.g., open-ended questions,
dialogue). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used in Large Language
Models (LLMs) to ground LLM outputs in retrieved knowledge, helps reduce
hallucinations and improve natural language generation (NLG). However, despite
its promise, no open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline
design for ELMs currently exists. To address this gap, we present the first
open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies
for NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG
consistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM
design considerations. Our code is available at:
https://github.com/willxxy/ECG-Bench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个校准概率自动评分器的通用框架，通过建模目标人群的完整偏好分布来解决LLM自动评分器的主观性、模糊性和细微差别问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM自动评分器存在根本性问题：它们基于离散偏好标签训练，将单一标准强加于主观、模糊或细微的任务上，限制了可靠性。

Method: 提出了两种学习方法：1）针对密集概率标签的直接监督微调；2）针对稀疏二元标签的强化学习方法，使用分布匹配目标来微调自动评分器。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用分布匹配目标微调的自动评分器能够产生与目标偏好分布更一致的言语化概率预测，具有更好的校准性和显著降低的位置偏差，同时在客观任务上保持性能。

Conclusion: 通过建模完整偏好分布来校准概率自动评分器，可以有效提高其可靠性，更好地处理主观性任务，同时保持客观任务的性能。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values increasingly
relies on using other LLMs as automated judges, or ``autoraters''. However,
their reliability is limited by a foundational issue: they are trained on
discrete preference labels, forcing a single ground truth onto tasks that are
often subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced. We argue that a reliable autorater
must learn to model the full distribution of preferences defined by a target
population. In this paper, we propose a general framework for calibrating
probabilistic autoraters to any given preference distribution. We formalize the
problem and present two learning methods tailored to different data conditions:
1) a direct supervised fine-tuning for dense, probabilistic labels, and 2) a
reinforcement learning approach for sparse, binary labels. Our empirical
results show that finetuning autoraters with a distribution-matching objective
leads to verbalized probability predictions that are better aligned with the
target preference distribution, with improved calibration and significantly
lower positional bias, all while preserving performance on objective tasks.

*Zhexiong Liu,Diane Litman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IR-Tuning：一种基于梯度范数分布动态选择重要LLM层进行参数高效微调的框架，用于解决文本修订分类任务中标注数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在文本生成任务中表现出色，但在文本分类特别是细粒度文本修订分类任务中表现不佳，且传统微调方法需要大量昂贵的标注数据。

Method: 提出IR-Tuning框架，基于梯度范数分布动态选择重要的LLM层进行参数高效微调，同时冻结冗余层。

Result: 实验表明IR-Tuning在多种文本修订任务上优于其他层间PEFT基线方法，具有快速收敛、低GPU内存消耗和小样本有效性的优势。

Conclusion: IR-Tuning为LLM在细粒度文本分类任务中的高效微调提供了有效解决方案，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary success across various
text generation tasks; however, their potential for simple yet essential text
classification remains underexplored, as LLM pre-training tends to emphasize
generation over classification. While LLMs with instruction tuning can
transform classification into a generation task, they often struggle to
categorize nuanced texts. One such example is text revision, which involves
nuanced edits between pairs of texts. Although simply fine-tuning LLMs for
revision classification seems plausible, it requires a large amount of revision
annotations, which are exceptionally expensive and scarce in the community. To
address this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play layer-wise parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) framework, i.e., IR-Tuning, which fine-tunes a subset of
important LLM layers that are dynamically selected based on their gradient norm
distribution, while freezing those of redundant layers. Extensive experiments
suggest that IR-Tuning surpasses several layer-wise PEFT baselines over diverse
text revisions, while achieving fast convergence, low GPU memory consumption,
and effectiveness on small revision corpora.

### [11] [SafePassage: High-Fidelity Information Extraction with Black Box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00276)
*Joe Barrow,Raj Patel,Misha Kharkovski,Ben Davies,Ryan Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy
to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction
pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the
document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe
passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document
and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a
three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that
generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a
string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using
these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on
information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations.
High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of
extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs.
Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on
a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at
flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as
1-2 hours.

*Ruochen Li,Jun Li,Bailiang Jian,Kun Yuan,Youxiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个临床基础的元评估框架，重新思考放射学报告自动生成评估指标的设计和评估，揭示现有指标在临床语义解释方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动生成的放射学报告在现有评估指标中得分很高，但未能获得临床医生的信任，这揭示了当前评估指标在评估生成报告质量方面存在根本性缺陷。

Method: 提出了临床基础的元评估框架，定义了涵盖临床对齐和关键指标能力的标准，包括区分度、鲁棒性和单调性。使用包含错误类型、临床显著性标签和解释的细粒度数据集系统评估现有指标。

Result: 揭示了现有指标在解释临床语义方面的局限性，包括无法区分临床显著错误、过度惩罚无害变异以及在不同错误严重程度级别上缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更临床可靠的评估方法提供了指导。

Abstract: Automatically generated radiology reports often receive high scores from
existing evaluation metrics but fail to earn clinicians' trust. This gap
reveals fundamental flaws in how current metrics assess the quality of
generated reports. We rethink the design and evaluation of these metrics and
propose a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework. We define clinically
grounded criteria spanning clinical alignment and key metric capabilities,
including discrimination, robustness, and monotonicity. Using a fine-grained
dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types,
clinical significance labels, and explanations, we systematically evaluate
existing metrics and reveal their limitations in interpreting clinical
semantics, such as failing to distinguish clinically significant errors,
over-penalizing harmless variations, and lacking consistency across error
severity levels. Our framework offers guidance for building more clinically
reliable evaluation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于transformer的语言模型在透明度方面的挑战，以及从众多可解释方法和评估指标中选择最优方案的困难

Method: 开发o-mega超参数优化工具，系统探索不同可解释方法及其超参数配置，在社交媒体帖子与反驳声明匹配的管道上进行评估

Conclusion: o-mega工具能够显著增强关键应用（如错误信息检测）中声明匹配模型的可解释性，有助于构建更可信和透明的AI系统

Abstract: The proliferation of transformer-based language models has revolutionized NLP
domain while simultaneously introduced significant challenges regarding model
transparency and trustworthiness. The complexity of achieving explainable
systems in this domain is evidenced by the extensive array of explanation
methods and evaluation metrics developed by researchers. To address the
challenge of selecting optimal explainability approaches, we present
\textbf{\texttt{o-mega}}, a hyperparameter optimization tool designed to
automatically identify the most effective explainable AI methods and their
configurations within the semantic matching domain. We evaluate o-mega on a
post-claim matching pipeline using a curated dataset of social media posts
paired with refuting claims. Our tool systematically explores different
explainable methods and their hyperparameters, demonstrating improved
transparency in automated fact-checking systems. As a result, such automated
optimization of explanation methods can significantly enhance the
interpretability of claim-matching models in critical applications such as
misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI
systems.

### [14] [CORTEX: Collaborative LLM Agents for High-Stakes Alert Triage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00311)
*Bowen Wei,Yuan Shen Tay,Howard Liu,Jinhao Pan,Kun Luo,Ziwei Zhu,Chris Jordan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORTEX是一个多智能体LLM架构，用于安全运营中心的高风险警报分类，通过专门智能体协作处理真实证据，显著减少误报并提高调查质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全运营中心每天面临数万条警报，只有少量是真实攻击，导致警报疲劳、威胁被忽视和分析师倦怠。传统检测管道脆弱且缺乏上下文，而单模型LLM方法难以处理嘈杂的企业数据且透明度有限。

Method: 提出CORTEX多智能体LLM架构，包含行为分析智能体检查活动序列、证据收集智能体查询外部系统、推理智能体综合发现形成可审计决策。

Result: 在多样化企业场景中，CORTEX相比最先进的单智能体LLM方法，显著减少误报并提高调查质量。

Conclusion: 多智能体协作方法比单模型方法更适合处理复杂的企业安全警报分类任务，提供了更好的透明度和性能。

Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are overwhelmed by tens of thousands of
daily alerts, with only a small fraction corresponding to genuine attacks. This
overload creates alert fatigue, leading to overlooked threats and analyst
burnout. Classical detection pipelines are brittle and context-poor, while
recent LLM-based approaches typically rely on a single model to interpret logs,
retrieve context, and adjudicate alerts end-to-end -- an approach that
struggles with noisy enterprise data and offers limited transparency. We
propose CORTEX, a multi-agent LLM architecture for high-stakes alert triage in
which specialized agents collaborate over real evidence: a behavior-analysis
agent inspects activity sequences, evidence-gathering agents query external
systems, and a reasoning agent synthesizes findings into an auditable decision.
To support training and evaluation, we release a dataset of fine-grained SOC
investigations from production environments, capturing step-by-step analyst
actions and linked tool outputs. Across diverse enterprise scenarios, CORTEX
substantially reduces false positives and improves investigation quality over
state-of-the-art single-agent LLMs.

### [15] [TokMem: Tokenized Procedural Memory for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00444)
*Zijun Wu,Yongchang Hao,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TokMem是一种标记化程序记忆，将重复程序存储为紧凑可训练的嵌入，通过记忆令牌编码程序地址和控制信号，实现恒定大小的目标行为控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型严重依赖提示来指定任务、回忆知识和指导推理，但这种依赖效率低下，因为提示必须在每一步重新读取，跨任务扩展性差，且缺乏模块化重用机制。

Method: 引入TokMem作为标记化程序记忆，保持主干模型冻结，允许添加新程序而不干扰现有程序。每个记忆令牌编码程序地址和控制信号，实现恒定大小的目标行为控制。

Result: 在1,000个原子回忆任务和函数调用任务上评估，TokMem始终优于检索增强生成，同时避免了重复上下文开销，且使用更少参数进行微调。

Conclusion: TokMem作为提示工程和微调的可扩展模块化替代方案，为LLM提供了显式的程序记忆。

Abstract: Large language models rely heavily on prompts to specify tasks, recall
knowledge and guide reasoning. However, this reliance is inefficient as prompts
must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms
for modular reuse. We introduce TokMem, a tokenized procedural memory that
stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings. Each memory token
encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers
generation, enabling targeted behavior with constant-size overhead. To support
continual adaptation, TokMem keeps the backbone model frozen, allowing new
procedures to be added without interfering with existing ones. We evaluate
TokMem on 1,000 tasks for atomic recall, and on function-calling tasks for
compositional recall, where it consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented
generation while avoiding repeated context overhead, and fine-tuning with far
fewer parameters. These results establish TokMem as a scalable and modular
alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering an explicit
procedural memory for LLMs.

*Yuling Shi,Yichun Qian,Hongyu Zhang,Beijun Shen,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongCodeZip是一个专为代码LLM设计的即插即用压缩框架，通过双阶段压缩策略实现高达5.6倍的压缩比，同时保持任务性能不下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文剪枝技术如LLMLingua主要针对通用文本，忽略了代码特有的结构和依赖关系，在编程任务中表现不佳。同时，处理长上下文时的高API成本和生成延迟成为主要瓶颈。

Method: 采用双阶段压缩策略：1）粗粒度压缩，使用条件困惑度识别和排序函数级块，仅保留最相关函数；2）细粒度压缩，将保留函数按困惑度分段，在自适应token预算下选择最优子集以最大化相关性。

Result: 在代码补全、摘要和问答等多个任务上的评估表明，LongCodeZip始终优于基线方法，实现高达5.6倍的压缩比且不降低任务性能。

Conclusion: 通过有效减小上下文大小同时保留关键信息，LongCodeZip使LLM能够更好地扩展到现实世界的大规模代码场景，提升了代码智能应用的效率和能力。

Abstract: Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as
Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information
in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs,
high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing
context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for
general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to
suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose
LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed
specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1)
coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks
using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only
the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments
retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal
subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across
multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question
answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods,
achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By
effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information,
LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code
scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence
applications.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了现成大语言模型在评分预测任务中的表现，发现用户评论能显著提升预测性能，效果可与传统矩阵分解方法媲美，为解决冷启动问题提供了有前景的方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注分类或排序任务，而忽略了需要语言和数学推理的Likert量表评分预测任务。该任务具有重要工业应用价值，但大语言模型在此领域的应用仍待探索。

Method: 通过三个数据集上的八个模型进行综合实验，提供不同的上下文信息，比较用户评论与一般偏好描述的效果，并探索了先生成假设评论的提示策略。

Result: 用户撰写的评论显著提升了大语言模型的评分预测性能，效果与传统矩阵分解方法相当。具体物品的评论比一般偏好描述更有效，先生成假设评论的提示策略能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 现成大语言模型在评分预测任务中表现出色，用户评论是关键影响因素，为解决推荐系统中的冷启动问题提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalizing the outputs of large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is an active research area. However, previous
studies have mainly focused on classification or ranking tasks and have not
considered Likert-scale rating prediction, a regression task that requires both
language and mathematical reasoning to be solved effectively. This task has
significant industrial applications, but the utilization of LLMs remains
underexplored, particularly regarding the capabilities of off-the-shelf LLMs.
This study investigates the performance of off-the-shelf LLMs on rating
prediction, providing different in-context information. Through comprehensive
experiments with eight models across three datasets, we demonstrate that
user-written reviews significantly improve the rating prediction performance of
LLMs. This result is comparable to traditional methods like matrix
factorization, highlighting the potential of LLMs as a promising solution for
the cold-start problem. We also find that the reviews for concrete items are
more effective than general preference descriptions that are not based on any
specific item. Furthermore, we discover that prompting LLMs to first generate a
hypothetical review enhances the rating prediction performance. Our code is
available at https://github.com/ynklab/rating-prediction-with-reviews.

Method: 使用JP1特定数据集（来自领域手册）和LLM生成的蒸馏推理轨迹对LLMs进行微调。推理时采用检索增强生成的代理提示，并引入上下文答案提取器来提高信息相关性。

Result: 在JP1认证考试问题上，该方法比基础模型实现了14%的性能提升，证明了代理微调在复杂微领域中领域特定推理的潜力。

Conclusion: 代理微调在专业微领域中具有显著效果，能够有效提升LLMs在领域特定任务中的决策准确性和搜索效率。

Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) have become prominent for autonomously
interacting with external environments and performing multi-step reasoning
tasks. Most approaches leverage these capabilities via in-context learning with
few-shot prompts, but this often results in lengthy inputs and higher
computational costs. Agent fine-tuning offers an alternative by enabling LLMs
to internalize procedural reasoning and domain-specific knowledge through
training on relevant data and demonstration trajectories. While prior studies
have focused on general domains, their effectiveness in specialized technical
microdomains remains unclear. This paper explores agent fine-tuning for domain
adaptation within Hitachi's JP1 middleware, a microdomain for specialized IT
operations. We fine-tuned LLMs using JP1-specific datasets derived from domain
manuals and distilled reasoning trajectories generated by LLMs themselves,
enhancing decision making accuracy and search efficiency. During inference, we
used an agentic prompt with retrieval-augmented generation and introduced a
context-answer extractor to improve information relevance. On JP1 certification
exam questions, our method achieved a 14% performance improvement over the base
model, demonstrating the potential of agent fine-tuning for domain-specific
reasoning in complex microdomains.

Motivation: 现有多模态代理在复杂或领域外任务中可靠性有限，需要探究它们是否存在伪推理问题。

Method: 提出了三种正交探测范式：视觉引导、文本引导和结构引导，在五个公开GUI基准测试中评估了18个多模态代理。

Result: 结果显示机械记忆往往超过系统推理，大多数模型主要作为训练对齐知识的检索器，表现出有限的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 强调了在现实场景中为多模态代理开发强大推理模型的必要性，为可靠多模态代理的发展提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Although numerous strategies have recently been proposed to enhance the
autonomous interaction capabilities of multimodal agents in graphical user
interface (GUI), their reliability remains limited when faced with complex or
out-of-domain tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Are existing
multimodal agents reasoning spuriously? In this paper, we propose
\textbf{Agent-ScanKit}, a systematic probing framework to unravel the memory
and reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents under controlled perturbations.
Specifically, we introduce three orthogonal probing paradigms: visual-guided,
text-guided, and structure-guided, each designed to quantify the contributions
of memorization and reasoning without requiring access to model internals. In
five publicly available GUI benchmarks involving 18 multimodal agents, the
results demonstrate that mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic
reasoning. Most of the models function predominantly as retrievers of
training-aligned knowledge, exhibiting limited generalization. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust reasoning modeling for multimodal agents in
real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights toward the development of
reliable multimodal agents.

Motivation: 传统语音对话系统使用级联流水线会丢弃副语言线索并限制表达性，而现有的端到端方法仍依赖文本中间体造成瓶颈。

Method: 采用模态分层架构和冻结预训练策略，在预训练文本LLM基础上添加原生语音能力，无需文本指导。

Result: 在口语问答任务中达到最先进水平，语音到语音性能与现有文本指导系统相当，同时保持竞争力的文本性能。

Conclusion: 通过缩小文本指导与直接语音生成之间的差距，为表达性和高效的端到端语音交互建立了新范式。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems often rely on cascaded pipelines that transcribe,
process, and resynthesize speech. While effective, this design discards
paralinguistic cues and limits expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods reduce
latency and better preserve these cues, yet still rely on text intermediates,
creating a fundamental bottleneck. We present MOSS-Speech, a true
speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates
speech without relying on text guidance. Our approach combines a modality-based
layer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy, preserving
the reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech
capabilities. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results
in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech
performance relative to existing text-guided systems, while still maintaining
competitive text performance. By narrowing the gap between text-guided and
direct speech generation, our work establishes a new paradigm for expressive
and efficient end-to-end speech interaction.

TL;DR: Graph2Eval是一个基于知识图谱的框架，用于自动生成多模态文档理解和网页交互任务，以全面评估智能代理的推理、协作和交互能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的合成数据方法主要针对LLM训练和评估设计，无法直接应用于需要工具使用和交互能力的代理任务。现有研究大多局限于文本或图像分析，缺乏对网页环境中多步交互的系统建模。

Method: 使用从多源外部数据构建的知识图谱作为任务空间，通过子图采样、任务模板和元路径将语义关系转化为结构化多模态任务。采用基于节点可达性、LLM评分和相似性分析的多阶段过滤管道来保证生成任务的质量和可执行性。

Result: 构建了Graph2Eval-Bench数据集，包含1,319个涵盖文档理解和网页交互场景的任务。实验表明Graph2Eval能有效生成区分代理和模型性能的任务，揭示不同设置下推理、协作和网页交互能力的差距。

Conclusion: Graph2Eval为代理评估提供了新视角，能够全面评估多类型代理（单代理、多代理、网页代理）的推理、协作和交互能力。

Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and
generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately
assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks.
Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training
and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require
tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored
automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text
or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in
web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a
knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal
document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive
evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities.
In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data
serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured
multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A
multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and
similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of
the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of
multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures
reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the
framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning
document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that
Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model
performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction
across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG中LLM不信任提供上下文导致的上下文不忠实幻觉问题，发现高复制度响应能减少幻觉。

Method: 提出CopyPasteLLM，通过两阶段高复制响应偏好训练，设计三种提示方法增强复制度，构建全自动训练管道。

Result: 在FaithEval、ConFiQA和PubMedQA上取得最佳性能，FaithEval准确率提升12.2%-24.5%，仅需365个训练样本（基线的1/50）。

Conclusion: CopyPasteLLM通过重新校准对内部参数知识的依赖而非外部知识，有效提升上下文忠实度，实现高效幻觉控制。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models
(LLMs) to generate contextually grounded responses, contextual faithfulness
remains challenging as LLMs may not consistently trust provided context,
leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability. We observe an inverse
correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful
hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce
hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM,
obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design
three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that
high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and
hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that
transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training
CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best
performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2%
to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while
requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate
CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying
Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates
reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during
generation. All codes are available at

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for
complex real-world tasks, yet existing systems often focus on isolated
improvements without a unifying design for robustness and adaptability. We
propose a generalist agent architecture that integrates three core components:
a collective multi-agent framework combining planning and execution agents with
critic model voting, a hierarchical memory system spanning working, semantic,

multimodal parsing. Evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark, our framework
consistently outperforms open-source baselines and approaches the performance
of proprietary systems. These results demonstrate the importance of
system-level integration and highlight a path toward scalable, resilient, and

Motivation: 现有多语言数据集对大多数语言包含的数据不足，导致训练模型在多数支持语言上表现不佳，需要为每种语言提供充足的训练数据。

Method: 使用可扩展的管道从议会录音构建数据集，包括鲁棒的媒体检索组件和两阶段对齐算法，处理非逐字记录和长音频。

Result: 从22个欧洲议会提取了61k+小时对齐语音片段，19种语言超过1k小时，22种语言超过500小时。微调现有ASR模型后，词错误率平均降低41.8%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效构建大规模多语言语音数据集，显著提升ASR模型在多语言场景下的性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality
performance across languages requires substantial training data for each
individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages,
they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models
perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses
this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech
datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust
components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to
handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to
recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned
speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages
exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech
data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines
when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the
usefulness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在大型语言模型的后训练阶段，传统的负对数似然(NLL)目标并非总是最优。通过实验发现，模型能力连续体是决定训练目标效果的关键维度：在模型能力强的一端，倾向于先验的目标表现更好；在模型能力弱的一端，NLL占优；中间区域则没有单一最优目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)是后训练大语言模型的标准方法，但其泛化能力有限。作者认为这可能源于其默认的负对数似然(NLL)训练目标，因为后训练阶段模型已具备任务相关先验，且监督信号可能冗长嘈杂，这违反了NLL的最优性假设。

Method: 研究了一系列基于概率的目标函数家族，通过7个模型主干、14个基准测试和3个领域的综合实验和消融研究，分析了不同条件下这些目标函数的有效性。

Result: 发现模型能力连续体是决定目标函数行为的关键维度：在模型能力强的一端，倾向于先验的目标函数(如$-p$, $-p^{10}$及其阈值变体)持续优于NLL；在模型能力弱的一端，NLL占主导；中间区域没有单一目标占优。

Conclusion: 理论分析阐明了不同目标函数在能力连续体上的权衡关系，为根据模型能力自适应选择目标函数提供了理论基础。研究挑战了后训练阶段NLL的默认地位，提出了更灵活的目标函数选择策略。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large
language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace
this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood
(NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch,
post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality
assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision
can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of
probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under
different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation
studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a
critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability
continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight
low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants)
consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in
between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further
elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a
principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability. Our code is
available at https://github.com/GaotangLi/Beyond-Log-Likelihood.

Motivation: GUI代理处理高分辨率截图时面临效率挑战，现有缓存压缩方法未充分考虑GUI的空间和时间冗余特性。

Method: 结合空间显著性指导（增强注意力分数）和时间冗余评分（投影历史帧到当前帧子空间），采用统一的预算分配策略。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，GUI-KV优于现有方法，在AgentNetBench上减少38.9%解码FLOPs同时提高4.1%步骤精度。

Conclusion: 利用GUI特定冗余可以实现高效可靠的代理性能。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on vision-language models have
emerged as a promising approach to automate human-computer workflows. However,
they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of
high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference
slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this,
storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing
cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the
spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze
attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural
images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers.
This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we
show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on
this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI
agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i)
spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of
hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii)
temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the
current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across
standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV
compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets.
Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV
reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the
full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific
redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.

Motivation: 小推理模型在工具使用时存在过度思考问题：达到正确的工具参数配置后继续推理，最终用错误的调用覆盖正确结果。这种问题在工具推理领域尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出ThinkBrake训练无关的解码启发式方法，在句子边界处监控</think>与当前top token之间的log-probability margin，当该margin变小时触发终止。

Result: 在Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard上，ThinkBrake在单轮、非实时和实时三个分集上保持或提升准确率，同时减少高达25%的token使用量，优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: ThinkBrake有效解决了小推理模型的过度思考问题，在工具推理任务中实现了更高效的推理过程，为工具使用场景提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Small reasoning models (SRMs) often overthink during tool use: they reach a
correct tool-argument configuration, then continue reasoning and overwrite it
with an incorrect final call. We diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that
inject </think> at sentence boundaries. On the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), this oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8\%
to 94.2\% while reducing tokens by 80-94\%, revealing substantial recoverable
headroom and potential redundant reasoning. While prior work on concise
reasoning has largely targeted mathematics, tool reasoning remains
underexplored. We adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and
introduce ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic. ThinkBrake monitors
the log-probability margin between </think> and the current top token at
sentence boundaries and triggers termination when this margin becomes small.
Across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits, ThinkBrake preserves or
improves accuracy while reducing tokens up to 25\%, outperforming various
baselines.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型是否真正理解在互联网上快速传播的病毒性内容——网络流行语，特别是中文语境下的文化内涵。

Method: 创建CHIME数据集，包含中文网络流行语的详细标注信息；设计两个评估任务：流行语解释任务（包括含义、起源、例句生成）和多项选择题任务（在上下文中选择合适的流行语）。

Result: 模型能够解释部分流行语的含义，但在文化和语言细微差异较大的类型上表现显著下降；模型普遍难以准确提供流行语的起源；在选择题任务中表现低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 大语言模型对中文网络流行语的理解能力有限，特别是在文化背景和起源追溯方面存在明显不足，CHIME数据集可为未来计算性流行语理解研究提供支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text from the
Internet, but do they truly understand the viral content that rapidly spreads
online -- commonly known as memes? In this paper, we introduce CHIME, a dataset
for CHinese Internet Meme Explanation. The dataset comprises popular
phrase-based memes from the Chinese Internet, annotated with detailed
information on their meaning, origin, example sentences, types, etc. To
evaluate whether LLMs understand these memes, we designed two tasks. In the
first task, we assessed the models' ability to explain a given meme, identify
its origin, and generate appropriate example sentences. The results show that
while LLMs can explain the meanings of some memes, their performance declines
significantly for culturally and linguistically nuanced meme types.
Additionally, they consistently struggle to provide accurate origins for the
memes. In the second task, we created a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs)

*Shiyu Li,Yang Tang,Yifan Wang,Peiming Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ReSeek框架，通过自我纠正机制和密集过程奖励训练搜索代理，在复杂推理任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的搜索代理依赖稀疏或基于规则的奖励，容易陷入次优推理路径且无法恢复。

Method: 引入自我纠正机制（JUDGE动作）让代理动态识别和纠正错误搜索路径，设计密集的过程奖励函数（正确性奖励和效用奖励），并使用新的基准数据集FictionalHot。

Result: 实验显示ReSeek训练的代理在任务成功率和路径忠实度方面显著优于最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: ReSeek框架通过自我纠正和密集奖励机制有效提升了搜索代理在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Search agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant potential in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training these agents to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning. However, prior RL-based methods often
rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead agents to commit to
suboptimal or erroneous reasoning paths without the ability to recover. To
address these limitations, we propose ReSeek, a novel self-correcting framework
for training search agents. Our framework introduces a self-correction
mechanism that empowers the agent to dynamically identify and recover from
erroneous search paths during an episode. By invoking a special JUDGE action,
the agent can judge the information and re-plan its search strategy. To guide
this process, we design a dense, instructive process reward function, which
decomposes into a correctness reward for retrieving factual information and a
utility reward for finding information genuinely useful for the query.
Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of data contamination in existing datasets,
we introduce FictionalHot, a new and challenging benchmark with recently
curated questions requiring complex reasoning. Being intuitively reasonable and
practically simple, extensive experiments show that agents trained with ReSeek
significantly outperform SOTA baselines in task success rate and path
faithfulness.

TL;DR: 提出CoT Vectors方法，通过紧凑表示编码多步推理知识，解决现有CoT实现成本高、效率低的问题，并在多种基准测试中优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示方法（如上下文学习和微调）成本高昂且效率低下，需要开发更经济高效的CoT推理方法。

Method: 引入CoT Vectors作为任务通用的多步推理知识紧凑表示，提出可学习的CoT Vectors在教师-学生框架下优化，提供更稳定和鲁棒的指导。

Result: CoT Vectors在多样化基准测试和模型中优于现有基线，性能与参数高效微调方法相当，但需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: CoT Vectors不仅提升了推理性能，还揭示了LLM中多步推理的功能组织机制，为理解模型推理过程提供了新视角。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
existing implementations, such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, remain
costly and inefficient. To improve CoT reasoning at a lower cost, and inspired
by the task vector paradigm, we introduce CoT Vectors, compact representations
that encode task-general, multi-step reasoning knowledge. Through experiments
with Extracted CoT Vectors, we observe pronounced layer-wise instability,
manifesting as a U-shaped performance curve that reflects a systematic
three-stage reasoning process in LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose
Learnable CoT Vectors, optimized under a teacher-student framework to provide
more stable and robust guidance. Extensive evaluations across diverse
benchmarks and models demonstrate that CoT Vectors not only outperform existing
baselines but also achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, by
treating CoT Vectors as a probe, we uncover how their effectiveness varies due
to latent space structure, information density, acquisition mechanisms, and
pre-training differences, offering new insights into the functional
organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs. The source code will be released.

Conclusion: 不仅推进了语言分割研究，还为代码切换语音技术建立了基础框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural spoken language diarization model that
supports an unconstrained span of languages within a single framework. Our
approach integrates a learnable query-based architecture grounded in
multilingual awareness, with large-scale pretraining on simulated
code-switching data. By jointly leveraging these two components, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches in data scarcity and
architecture optimization, and generalizes effectively to real-world
multilingual settings across diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
language diarization benchmarks, with a relative performance improvement of 23%
to 52% over previous methods. We believe that this work not only advances
research in language diarization but also establishes a foundational framework

Method: 创建了10,120个音节化Tenyidie词汇数据集，采用80:10:10的数据划分，应用了LSTM、BLSTM、BLSTM+CRF和编码器-解码器四种深度学习架构进行音节划分。

Result: 在测试集上，BLSTM模型取得了99.21%的最高准确率，表明深度学习模型在Tenyidie语言音节划分任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: 这项工作为Tenyidie语言创建了首个音节划分数据集，深度学习模型在该任务上取得了优异性能，将为该语言的形态分析、词性标注、机器翻译等NLP应用提供重要基础。

Abstract: The Tenyidie language is a low-resource language of the Tibeto-Burman family
spoken by the Tenyimia Community of Nagaland in the north-eastern part of India
and is considered a major language in Nagaland. It is tonal,
Subject-Object-Verb, and highly agglutinative in nature. Being a low-resource
language, very limited research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been
conducted. To the best of our knowledge, no work on syllabification has been
reported for this language. Among the many NLP tasks, syllabification or
syllabication is an important task in which the given word syllables are
identified. The contribution of this work is the creation of 10,120 syllabified
Tenyidie words and the application of the Deep Learning techniques on the
created corpus. In this paper, we have applied LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and
Encoder-decoder deep learning architectures on our created dataset. In our
dataset split of 80:10:10 (train:validation:test) set, we achieved the highest
accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set. This work will find its
application in numerous other NLP applications, such as morphological analysis,
part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, etc, for the Tenyidie Language.

TL;DR: 提出MCM-DPO方法，通过多维度偏好优化改进替代文本生成，无需精确标注，在Twitter和Pinterest数据上超越DPO和SFT方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前替代文本生成受限于噪声用户标注、不一致标准和MLLM对上下文信息不敏感的问题，SFT方法依赖准确标注但用户生成替代文本往往存在缺陷

Method: 提出多维度跨模态直接偏好优化(MCM-DPO)，在单样本、配对和多偏好维度优化偏好，涵盖文本、视觉和跨模态因素，构建TAlt和PAlt数据集

Result: 实验结果显示MCM-DPO方法在替代文本生成任务上持续优于DPO和SFT方法，建立了新的最先进水平

Conclusion: MCM-DPO方法有效解决了替代文本生成中的标注质量问题，通过偏好学习提升性能，发布的数据集和代码将促进该领域进一步研究

Abstract: The alt-text generation task produces concise, context-relevant descriptions
of images, enabling blind and low-vision users to access online images. Despite
the capabilities of large vision-language models, alt-text generation
performance remains limited due to noisy user annotations, inconsistent
standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to contextual information. Previous efforts
to fine-tune MLLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) have struggled, as SFT
relies on accurate target annotations, which are often flawed in user-generated
alt-text. To address this, we propose Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct
Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO), which improves alt-text generation by
learning to identify better options in preference pairs without requiring
precise annotations. MCM-DPO optimizes preferences across single, paired, and
multi-preference dimensions, covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors.
In light of the scarcity of high-quality annotated and preference-labeled
datasets for alt-text, we constructed two large-scale, high-quality datasets
named TAlt and PAlt, sourced from Twitter and Pinterest. These datasets include
202k annotated alt-text samples and 18k preference pairs that cover diverse
preference dimensions, aiming to support further research in this domain.
Experimental results show that our proposed MCM-DPO method consistently
outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text
generation. We release the code and data here:

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用大型语言模型自动生成易读文本的方法，提出了多任务学习框架，包括基于检索增强生成和多任务LoRA微调的两种策略，在Mistral-7B和LLaMA-3-8B模型上验证了多任务设置的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为认知障碍人群提供平等的信息获取机会，解决手动创建易读文本耗时耗力的问题，利用LLMs自动化生成符合Easy-to-Read标准的文本内容。

Method: 采用多任务学习方法，联合训练文本摘要、文本简化和ETR生成任务；探索了基于检索增强生成的上下文学习策略和参数高效微调的MTL-LoRA方法。

Result: 实验基于新构建的高质量数据集ETR-fr，多任务设置在所有配置中均优于单任务基线；RAG策略在域外设置中表现出泛化能力，MTL-LoRA在域内配置中优于所有学习策略。

Conclusion: 多任务学习框架能有效提升易读文本的自动生成质量，不同策略在不同场景下各有优势，为易读文本的自动化生成提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Simplifying complex texts is essential for ensuring equitable access to
information, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. The
Easy-to-Read (ETR) initiative offers a framework for making content accessible
to the neurodivergent population, but the manual creation of such texts remains
time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this work, we investigate the
potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of ETR
content. To address the scarcity of aligned corpora and the specificity of ETR
constraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that trains models
jointly on text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. We
explore two different strategies: multi-task retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for in-context learning, and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning. Our experiments with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B, based on ETR-fr, a
new high-quality dataset, demonstrate the benefits of multi-task setups over
single-task baselines across all configurations. Moreover, results show that
the RAG-based strategy enables generalization in out-of-domain settings, while
MTL-LoRA outperforms all learning strategies within in-domain configurations.

Conclusion: 参数高效微调的PLMs是生成高质量易读文本的有效方法，为认知障碍人士的信息可访问性提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments is
essential for autonomy, self-determination, and full citizenship. However,
manual Easy-to-Read (ETR) text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to
scale, limiting access to crucial information in healthcare, education, and
civic life. AI-driven ETR generation offers a scalable solution but faces key
challenges, including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing
lightweight learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we
introduce ETR-fr, the first dataset for ETR text generation fully compliant
with European ETR guidelines. We implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning on
PLMs and LLMs to establish generative baselines. To ensure high-quality and
accessible outputs, we introduce an evaluation framework based on automatic
metrics supplemented by human assessments. The latter is conducted using a
36-question evaluation form that is aligned with the guidelines. Overall
results show that PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to
out-of-domain texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阿拉伯语基准测试缺乏专门针对多步推理的数据集，特别是在开放式法律推理任务中，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 收集13,000多个沙特商业法庭案例，包括案件事实、法庭推理、判决结果和引用条款，设计判决预测、推理链补全和相关法规识别等任务。

Result: 指令调优12B参数模型后，在判决预测和阿拉伯语判决生成任务上表现显著提升，达到与GPT-4o相当的水平。

Conclusion: ALARB数据集有效评估和提升阿拉伯语LLMs的法律推理能力，证明了其在指令调优中的实用性。

Abstract: We introduce ALARB, a dataset and suite of tasks designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within the Arabic legal
domain. While existing Arabic benchmarks cover some knowledge-intensive tasks
such as retrieval and understanding, substantial datasets focusing specifically
on multistep reasoning for Arabic LLMs, especially in open-ended contexts, are
lacking. The dataset comprises over 13K commercial court cases from Saudi
Arabia, with each case including the facts presented, the reasoning of the
court, the verdict, as well as the cited clauses extracted from the regulatory
documents. We define a set of challenging tasks leveraging this dataset and
reflecting the complexity of real-world legal reasoning, including verdict
prediction, completion of reasoning chains in multistep legal arguments, and
identification of relevant regulations based on case facts. We benchmark a
representative selection of current open and closed Arabic LLMs on these tasks
and demonstrate the dataset's utility for instruction tuning. Notably, we show
that instruction-tuning a modest 12B parameter model using ALARB significantly
enhances its performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation,
reaching a level comparable to that of GPT-4o.

TL;DR: 该研究探索如何将小型高效LLM适配到低资源语言法罗语，通过从英语模型出发，在相关斯堪的纳维亚语言上继续预训练，然后对法罗语进行微调，比较了全微调和LoRA参数高效调优的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究法罗语这种低资源北日耳曼语言的LLM适配问题，由于缺乏现有评估数据，需要构建新的基准测试。

Method: 从英语模型开始，在相关斯堪的纳维亚语言上继续预训练（单独或合并），然后对法罗语进行微调，比较全微调与LoRA方法，构建新的最小对基准测试并进行人工评估。

Result: 相关语言的迁移至关重要，但最佳源语言因任务而异：冰岛语提高语言准确性，丹麦语增强理解能力。LoRA在基础模型上提高语言可接受性和人工评估分数，全微调在理解任务上表现更好且在下游微调中更好地保留模型能力。

Conclusion: 低资源语言适配需要任务特定的方法选择，语言迁移策略和微调方法都应根据具体任务需求进行优化。

Abstract: We investigate how to adapt small, efficient LLMs to Faroese, a low-resource
North Germanic language. Starting from English models, we continue pre-training
on related Scandinavian languages, either individually or combined via merging,
before fine-tuning on Faroese. We compare full fine-tuning with
parameter-efficient tuning using LoRA, evaluating their impact on both
linguistic accuracy and text comprehension. Due to the lack of existing Faroese
evaluation data, we construct two new minimal-pair benchmarks from adapted and
newly collected datasets and complement them with human evaluations by Faroese
linguists. Our results demonstrate that transfer from related languages is
crucial, though the optimal source language depends on the task: Icelandic
enhances linguistic accuracy, whereas Danish boosts comprehension. Similarly,
the choice between full fine-tuning and LoRA is task-dependent: LoRA improves
linguistic acceptability and slightly increases human evaluation scores on the
base model, while full fine-tuning yields stronger comprehension performance
and better preserves model capabilities during downstream fine-tuning.

Motivation: 理解检索增强LLM机器翻译在真实世界噪声检索环境下的可靠性问题，特别是针对习语翻译任务。

Method: 提出噪声合成框架和新指标，使用Qwen系列模型（包括标准LLM和增强推理LRM）在不同资源语言对下评估REAL-MT的鲁棒性。

Result: 低资源语言对在噪声下退化更严重，常产生无意义翻译；LRM虽具增强推理能力但无法改善错误纠正，反而更易受噪声影响，倾向于合理化错误上下文。

Conclusion: 当前方法存在局限性，需要自验证集成机制，训练无关和微调策略虽能提高鲁棒性但会牺牲干净上下文下的性能，揭示了基本权衡关系。

Abstract: \textbf{RE}trieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{M}achine
\textbf{T}ranslation (REAL-MT) shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks like
idiomatic translation, but its reliability under noisy retrieval contexts
remains poorly understood despite this being a common challenge in real-world
deployment. To address this gap, we propose a noise synthesis framework and new
metrics to evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT systematically. Using this
framework, we instantiate REAL-MT with Qwen-series models, including standard
LLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) with enhanced reasoning, and evaluate
their performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and
low-resource language pairs under synthesized noise. Our results show that
low-resource language pairs, which rely more heavily on retrieved context,
degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce
nonsensical translations. Although LRMs possess enhanced reasoning
capabilities, they show no improvement in error correction and are even more
susceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. We find that
this stems from an attention shift away from the source idiom to noisy content,
while confidence increases despite declining accuracy, indicating poor
calibration. To mitigate these issues, we investigate training-free and
fine-tuning strategies, which improve robustness at the cost of performance in
clean contexts, revealing a fundamental trade-off. Our findings highlight the
limitations of current approaches, underscoring the need for self-verifying
integration mechanisms.

TL;DR: ManagerBench是一个评估LLM在管理场景中安全决策能力的基准测试，专注于操作目标与人类安全之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全基准主要关注防止生成有害内容，但忽视了当操作目标与人类安全冲突时，代理可能采取有害行动的问题。

Method: 创建包含人类验证的管理场景，每个场景都要求在实现操作目标的实用但有害行动与安全但性能较差的行动之间做出选择，并设置平行控制集来测量模型的实用主义倾向。

Result: 前沿LLM在安全与实用权衡方面表现不佳，许多模型为推进操作目标持续选择有害选项，而其他模型则过于安全而变得无效。模型能够感知危害但存在优先级排序问题。

Conclusion: ManagerBench是评估代理行为核心组件的重要基准，即在操作目标和价值对齐激励冲突时做出安全选择的能力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into
autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical.
Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of
harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of
agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational
goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce
ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic,
human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a
pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe
action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set,
where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's
pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate
that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism
trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their
operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and
ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an
inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human
judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging
benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when
operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前搜索增强的大型语言模型在复杂多跳推理中存在可靠性问题，主要源于三个基本挑战：分解错误、检索缺失和推理错误，任一阶段的失败都会导致最终答案错误。

Method: 提出可擦除强化学习(ERL)框架，明确识别错误步骤，擦除它们并在原地重新生成推理，防止错误逻辑在推理链中传播。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MuSiQue、2Wiki和Bamboogle等数据集上取得显著提升，3B模型比之前SOTA提升+8.48% EM和+11.56% F1，7B模型提升+5.38% EM和+7.22% F1。

Conclusion: 可擦除强化学习为LLM中的鲁棒多步推理提供了强大的范式转变。

Abstract: While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive
capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited.
This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors,
where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence
fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates
through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail
the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel
framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL
explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in
place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain.
This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more
resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial
improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model
achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and
+7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest
that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for
robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: HalluGuard是一个40亿参数的小型推理模型，专门用于缓解检索增强生成(RAG)中的幻觉问题，通过分类文档-声明对并提供基于证据的证明，在保持较小模型规模的同时达到与更大模型相当的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在NLP任务中表现出色但容易产生幻觉，限制了在实际应用中的可信度，需要开发专门针对幻觉缓解的解决方案。

Method: 结合领域无关的合成数据集、合成的真实和幻觉声明，以及基于偏好的微调(Odds Ratio Preference Optimization)，将大型模型的推理能力蒸馏到较小的骨干网络中。

Result: 在RAGTruth子集上达到84.0%的平衡准确率，与MiniCheck(7B)和Granite Guardian 3.3(8B)相当但参数减半；在整个基准测试中达到75.7% BAcc，与GPT-4o(75.9%)相当。

Conclusion: HalluGuard证明了通过精心设计的数据集和优化方法，可以在较小模型规模下有效缓解RAG中的幻觉问题，达到与更大模型相当的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many NLP tasks but remain prone to
hallucinations, limiting trust in real-world applications. We present
HalluGuard, a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model (SRM) for mitigating
hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). HalluGuard classifies
document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated and produces evidence-grounded
justifications for transparency. Our approach combines (i) a domain-agnostic
synthetic dataset derived from FineWeb and refined through multi-stage curation
and data reformation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and
(iii) preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to
distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. On the RAGTruth subset
of the LLM-AggreFact benchmark, HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy
(BAcc), rivaling specialized models, MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian
3.3 (8B; 82.2%) while using roughly half their parameters. Over the full
benchmark it reaches 75.7% BAcc, matching larger general-purpose LLMs such as
GPT-4o (75.9%). We will release HalluGuard and datasets under Apache 2.0 upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: Sci-SpanDet是一个用于检测AI生成学术文本的结构感知框架，通过结合分段条件风格建模和多级对比学习，实现了精确的片段级检测和跨领域鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在科学写作中的快速应用，引发了关于作者身份完整性和学术出版物可靠性的严重担忧。现有检测方法主要依赖文档级分类或表面统计线索，但忽视了细粒度片段定位，校准能力弱，且难以跨学科和生成器泛化。

Method: 结合分段条件风格建模与多级对比学习来捕捉细微的人类-AI差异并减轻主题依赖性；集成BIO-CRF序列标注与基于指针的边界解码和置信度校准，实现精确的片段级检测和可靠的概率估计。

Result: 在包含10万个标注样本的新建跨学科数据集上，Sci-SpanDet实现了最先进的性能：AI-F1为80.17，AUROC为92.63，Span-F1为74.36。在对抗性重写下表现出强韧性，在IMRaD分段和多样学科中保持平衡准确率。

Conclusion: Sci-SpanDet显著超越了现有基线方法，为学术文档中AI生成文本检测提供了有效的解决方案。为确保可复现性，策划的数据集和源代码将在发表后公开。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scientific writing
raises serious concerns regarding authorship integrity and the reliability of
scholarly publications. Existing detection approaches mainly rely on
document-level classification or surface-level statistical cues; however, they
neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and often
fail to generalize across disciplines and generators. To address these
limitations, we present Sci-SpanDet, a structure-aware framework for detecting
AI-generated scholarly texts. The proposed method combines section-conditioned
stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture nuanced
human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence, thereby enhancing
cross-domain robustness. In addition, it integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling
with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration to enable
precise span-level detection and reliable probability estimates. Extensive
experiments on a newly constructed cross-disciplinary dataset of 100,000
annotated samples generated by multiple LLM families (GPT, Qwen, DeepSeek,
LLaMA) demonstrate that Sci-SpanDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36. Furthermore, it shows
strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy
across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines, substantially surpassing
existing baselines. To ensure reproducibility and to foster further research on
AI-generated text detection in scholarly documents, the curated dataset and
source code will be publicly released upon publication.

TL;DR: 论文研究了检索增强生成(RAG)在解决奥林匹克级别物理问题中的应用，提出了PhoPile多模态数据集，并证明了RAG能提升基础模型在物理推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RAG在专家级物理推理任务（如解决奥林匹克物理问题）中的潜力，受学生通过复习过往问题准备竞赛的启发。

Method: 引入PhoPile多模态数据集，包含图表、图形和方程；使用该数据集对RAG增强的基础模型（包括LLMs和LMMs）进行基准测试，并比较多种检索器。

Result: 结果表明，将检索与物理语料库集成可以提高模型性能，但也揭示了在检索增强物理推理方面需要进一步研究的挑战。

Conclusion: RAG在提升基础模型的物理推理能力方面具有潜力，但仍有挑战需要解决，为检索增强物理推理的进一步研究提供了动力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with foundation models has achieved
strong performance across diverse tasks, but their capacity for expert-level
reasoning-such as solving Olympiad-level physics problems-remains largely
unexplored. Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing
past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning
in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset
specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of
retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations,
capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using
PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large
language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple
retrievers. Our results demonstrate that integrating retrieval with physics
corpora can improve model performance, while also highlighting challenges that
motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

*Ammar Khairi,Daniel D'souza,Marzieh Fadaee,Julia Kreutzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Fusion-of-N方法，使用通用LLM评判器将多个样本中最具信息量的元素融合成一个最终答案，相比传统的Best-of-N方法在测试时扩展和合成数据生成中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Best-of-N方法本质上是零和游戏，丢弃了池中多样且可能有用的信息，需要探索协作设置让所有候选都能为最终生成做出贡献。

Method: 使用通用LLM评判器来合成每个样本中最具信息量的元素，形成单一最终答案，在测试时扩展和合成数据生成两种设置中应用。

Result: 在11种语言、3个多样化任务和不同模型规模上的广泛基准测试中，FusioN始终优于BoN，在测试时扩展和合成数据生成的下游增益方面显示出多功能性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 应该从单一质量度量转向接受LLM生成的多面性，通过整合多样优势、释放潜在能力，实现仅通过选择无法达到的改进。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality generations in modern LLMs has largely been framed as
a selection problem: identifying a single winning generation from a diverse
pool of N samples, the Best-of-N (BoN). Yet, this approach is inherently
zero-sum, discarding diverse and potentially useful information from the pool.
Instead, we explore a collaborative setup, where all candidates can potentially
contribute to the final winning generation. To this end, we propose Fusion-of-N
(FusioN): a method that uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most
informative elements of each sample into a single final answer. We compare
FusioN to BoN in two settings, (i) test-time scaling, where we sample and
aggregate from a single model at test-time (ii) synthetic data generation,
where we fuse samples from a pool of diverse teachers to improve a student
model. We extensively benchmark both setups across 11 languages, 3 diverse
tasks and varying model scales. Across the bench, FusioN consistently
outperforms BoN showing versatility and robustness both in test-time scaling
and in downstream gains from synthetic data generation. We also perform
extensive analysis on FusioN, where it shows surprising strengths and
robustness under challenging settings. These results show that we should shift
how we think about evaluating and utilizing LLM generations from a monolithic
measure of quality, to embracing their polylithic nature. This shift allows us
to integrate diverse strengths, unlock latent potential, and achieve
improvements that were previously inaccessible through selection alone.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在处理非标准英语方言时性能下降达20%，主要归因于三个特定语法规则：存在性"it"、零系词和"y'all"的使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析LLMs在处理非标准英语方言时的性能下降问题，探究语法规则对性能影响的具体机制。

Method: 通过将标准美式英语问题转换为非标准方言变体，在多项选择问答任务中测试LLM性能，并分析具体语法规则的影响。

Result: 非标准英语问题导致准确率下降达20%，其中三个语法规则（存在性"it"、零系词、"y'all"）解释了大部分性能下降。

Conclusion: 呼吁未来研究关注针对个别高影响力语法结构的偏见缓解方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are ubiquitous in modern day natural language
processing. However, previous work has shown degraded LLM performance for
under-represented English dialects. We analyze the effects of typifying
"standard" American English language questions as non-"standard" dialectal
variants on multiple choice question answering tasks and find up to a 20%
reduction in accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the grammatical basis of
under-performance in non-"standard" English questions. We find that individual
grammatical rules have varied effects on performance, but some are more
consequential than others: three specific grammar rules (existential "it", zero
copula, and y'all) can explain the majority of performance degradation observed
in multiple dialects. We call for future work to investigate bias mitigation
methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种语法引导的扩散语言模型，通过结构监督和个性化条件来提升文本质量、多样性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的文本往往过于通用，缺乏结构多样性，限制了个性化表达。扩散模型为超越自回归范式提供了新机会。

Method: 采用级联框架先生成语法指导再进行条件文本生成，并推广到非级联架构以更好地对齐结构和内容。引入共享表示机制支持细粒度个性化。

Result: 在多个任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在流畅性、多样性和风格保真度方面具有优越性。

Conclusion: 该模型通过整合语法信息，能更好地捕捉风格化句子构建的词汇和结构特征，支持个性化模式学习和零样本推理。

Abstract: Large language models have made revolutionary progress in generating
human-like text, yet their outputs often tend to be generic, exhibiting
insufficient structural diversity, which limits personalized expression. Recent
advances in diffusion models have opened new opportunities for improving
language generation beyond the limitations of autoregressive paradigms. In this
work, we propose a syntax-guided diffusion language model that integrates
structural supervision and personalized conditioning to enhance text quality,
diversity, and controllability. We introduce a cascaded framework that
generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and further
generalize it to a novel noncascaded architecture for better alignment between
structure and content. By incorporating syntactic information in the generating
process, the proposed model better captures the lexical and structural
characteristics of stylistic sentence construction. To enable fine-grained
personalization, we develop a shared representation mechanism that facilitates
information integration across users, supporting both faithful stylistic
generation and generalizable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on
multiple tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in fluency,
diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Further qualitative analyses highlight its
interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.

Method: 综述了使用生成模型为模型组件生成开放词汇自然语言概念描述的关键方法，包括自动化和人工评估指标以及支撑研究的数据集。

Result: 揭示了该领域对更严谨因果评估的日益增长需求，现有方法在模型透明度方面仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 通过梳理最新进展和识别关键挑战，为未来研究提供了路线图，旨在使模型更加透明可解释。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central
goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the
roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as
well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this
challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary,
natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we
provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for
model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating
these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for
evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis
reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the
state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap
for future research toward making models more transparent.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合对话状态跟踪模型，结合规则方法和语言模型，在波斯语多轮对话数据集上显著提升了准确性和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的DST方法在开放域和多轮聊天机器人中效率不足，无法为复杂对话提供所需的适应性和连贯性。

Method: 使用BERT进行槽填充和意图检测，XGBoost进行意图验证，GPT进行DST，在线代理进行实时答案生成的混合模型。

Result: 在波斯语聊天机器人中，相比现有方法显著提高了准确性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 混合方法能有效提升DST能力，为更定制化、适应性更强、更人性化的对话AI系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is an essential element of conversational AI
with the objective of deeply understanding the conversation context and leading
it toward answering user requests. Due to high demands for open-domain and
multi-turn chatbots, the traditional rule-based DST is not efficient enough,
since it cannot provide the required adaptability and coherence for human-like
experiences in complex conversations. This study proposes a hybrid DST model
that utilizes rule-based methods along with language models, including BERT for
slot filling and intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST,
and online agents for real-time answer generation. This model is uniquely
designed to be evaluated on a comprehensive Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset
and demonstrated significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing
methods in Persian-based chatbots. The results demonstrate how effectively a
hybrid approach may improve DST capabilities, paving the way for conversational
AI systems that are more customized, adaptable, and human-like.

TL;DR: 本文对2020-2025年间非洲低资源语言自动语音识别(ASR)研究进行系统性综述，发现数据集稀缺、模型可复现性差、评估指标单一等问题，并提出社区驱动、伦理数据集和轻量建模等改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲拥有2000多种语言，但低资源语言的ASR研究严重不足，阻碍了数字包容性发展。需要系统梳理现有研究现状、挑战和未来方向。

Method: 采用PRISMA 2020方法，检索DBLP、ACM Digital Library等数据库，筛选出71篇相关研究，分析74个数据集覆盖111种语言约11,206小时语音数据。

Result: 发现只有不到15%的研究提供可复现材料，数据集许可不明确；自监督和迁移学习有潜力但受限于预训练数据；主要使用WER指标，缺乏对音调和形态丰富语言的针对性评估。

Conclusion: ASR系统证据不一致，受数据集可用性、标注质量等限制。社区驱动倡议和方法进步提供了改进路径，可持续发展需要利益相关者合作、伦理数据集、轻量建模和主动基准测试。

Abstract: ASR has achieved remarkable global progress, yet African low-resource
languages remain rigorously underrepresented, producing barriers to digital
inclusion across the continent with more than +2000 languages. This systematic
literature review (SLR) explores research on ASR for African languages with a
focus on datasets, models and training methods, evaluation techniques,
challenges, and recommends future directions. We employ the PRISMA 2020
procedures and search DBLP, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, Semantic
Scholar, and arXiv for studies published between January 2020 and July 2025. We
include studies related to ASR datasets, models or metrics for African
languages, while excluding non-African, duplicates, and low-quality studies
(score <3/5). We screen 71 out of 2,062 records and we record a total of 74
datasets across 111 languages, encompassing approximately 11,206 hours of
speech. Fewer than 15% of research provided reproducible materials, and dataset
licensing is not clear. Self-supervised and transfer learning techniques are
promising, but are hindered by limited pre-training data, inadequate coverage
of dialects, and the availability of resources. Most of the researchers use
Word Error Rate (WER), with very minimal use of linguistically informed scores
such as Character Error Rate (CER) or Diacritic Error Rate (DER), and thus with
limited application in tonal and morphologically rich languages. The existing
evidence on ASR systems is inconsistent, hindered by issues like dataset
availability, poor annotations, licensing uncertainties, and limited
benchmarking. Nevertheless, the rise of community-driven initiatives and
methodological advancements indicates a pathway for improvement. Sustainable
development for this area will also include stakeholder partnership, creation
of ethically well-balanced datasets, use of lightweight modelling techniques,
and active benchmarking.

Motivation: 大型语言模型评估在英语中有效，但在非英语环境中表现不佳，且不清楚如何有效训练多语言评估模型。

Method: 通过大规模多语言训练，整合目标语言推理数据集，研究数据和课程选择策略来构建高质量奖励模型。

Result: 在多语言奖励模型基准测试中达到最先进性能，超越GPT-OSS-120B等更大模型，同时体积缩小9倍。

Conclusion: mR3证明了构建高效多语言奖励模型的有效策略，模型、数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Evaluation using Large Language Model (LLM) judges has been widely adopted in
English and shown to be effective for automatic evaluation. However, their
performance does not generalize well to non-English settings, and it remains
unclear what constitutes effective multilingual training for such judges. In
this paper, we introduce mR3, a massively multilingual, rubric-agnostic reward
reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving the broadest language
coverage in reward modeling to date. We present a comprehensive study of data
and curriculum selection for training to identify effective strategies and data
sources for building high-quality reward models, including the integration of
target-language reasoning datasets. Our approach attains state-of-the-art
performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger
models (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, and its effectiveness
is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies. Our models, data, and
code are available as open source at https://github.com/rubricreward/mr3.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MASH是一个通过强化学习训练LLM选择性求助的框架，将外部搜索工具的使用作为弃权的代理，在惩罚搜索的同时奖励答案准确性，从而让LLM学会在知识边界外的问题上弃权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM无法可靠识别自身知识边界，经常对边界外问题产生幻觉答案，而人类能够识别自身局限并寻求外部帮助或弃权。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，通过按次搜索付费的奖励机制，训练LLM在需要外部知识时使用搜索工具，否则直接回答。

Result: 在三个知识密集型QA数据集上，MASH显著优于先前的高效搜索方法，在多跳数据集上答案准确率提升7.6%，并能有效区分可回答/不可回答问题。

Conclusion: MASH训练有效对齐了搜索工具使用与参数知识，无需预先确定知识边界即可实现弃权决策，展示了与专门弃权方法类似的行为。

Abstract: LLMs cannot reliably recognize their parametric knowledge boundaries and
often hallucinate answers to outside-of-boundary questions. In contrast, humans
recognize their limitations and can either seek external help for such
questions or abstain. In this paper, we introduce MASH (Modeling Abstention via
Selective Help-seeking), a training framework that readily extracts abstentions
from LLMs. Our key idea is that any external help-seeking by an LLM, i.e.
search tool use, can serve as a proxy for abstention if the external help
(search) is appropriately penalized while simultaneously rewarding answer
accuracy. MASH operationalizes this idea using reinforcement learning with a
pay-per-search reward.
  We run experiments on three knowledge-intensive QA datasets. Our results show
that MASH substantially improves upon the selective help-seeking performance of
prior efficient search approaches; on multi-hop datasets, MASH improves answer
accuracy by 7.6%. Furthermore, MASH demonstrates strong off-the-shelf
abstention -- it can distinguish between unanswerable/answerable questions and
selectively generate responses for answerable questions -- showcasing behavior
analogous to specialized abstention approaches. We emphasize that contrary to
prior abstention methods, MASH does not require pre-determining knowledge
boundaries to construct training data. Instead, MASH's abstentions are a
by-product of training for the auxiliary selective help-seeking task. Overall,
we show that MASH training effectively aligns search tool use with parametric
knowledge, which can be successfully leveraged for making abstention decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型及其多模态扩展日益流行，但级联领域特定编码器的方法会使模型继承所有组件的漏洞，因此需要研究音频后门攻击的威胁。

Method: 通过系统实验评估音频后门攻击在四个语音编码器和三个数据集上的效果，涵盖四个任务：语音识别、语音情感识别、性别和年龄预测，并进行组件级分析识别最脆弱环节。

Result: 攻击在四个任务上均取得高成功率，范围从90.76%到99.41%，证明音频后门攻击对语音语言模型构成严重威胁。

Conclusion: 语音语言模型对音频后门攻击高度脆弱，提出的微调防御方法能有效缓解预训练编码器中毒的威胁。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions are becoming
increasingly popular. One common approach to enable multimodality is to cascade
domain-specific encoders with an LLM, making the resulting model inherit
vulnerabilities from all of its components. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across four speech encoders and three datasets,
covering four tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech emotion
recognition, and gender and age prediction. The attack consistently achieves
high success rates, ranging from 90.76% to 99.41%. To better understand how
backdoors propagate, we conduct a component-wise analysis to identify the most
vulnerable stages of the pipeline. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning-based
defense that mitigates the threat of poisoned pretrained encoders.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了社会福利函数基准测试，评估大语言模型在社会资源分配中的表现，发现大多数模型偏向功利主义，优先考虑群体效率而非公平分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被越来越多地用于高风险决策，需要评估这些模型在分配稀缺社会资源时的原则和价值观。

Method: 引入社会福利函数基准测试，这是一个动态模拟环境，让LLM作为分配者向异质社区分配任务，在集体效率和分配公平之间创建持续权衡。

Result: 评估了20个最先进的LLM，发现：1）通用对话能力不能预测分配技能；2）大多数模型具有强烈的功利主义倾向；3）分配策略容易受到输出长度限制和社会影响框架的干扰。

Conclusion: 当前LLM作为社会决策者存在风险，需要专门的基准测试和针对性对齐来改进AI治理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly entrusted with high-stakes
decisions that affect human welfare. However, the principles and values that
guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely
unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF)
Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign
allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The
benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing
collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring
distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20
state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare
allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general
conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor
predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default
utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of
severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily
perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These
results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal
decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted
alignment for AI governance.

Motivation: 传统RAG方法依赖静态数据库，缺乏适应性且可能产生不相关的演示，限制了LLM在上下文支持方面的效果。

Method: 训练LLM模型生成输入特定的简洁演示，动态地为每个输入提供定制化的上下文支持。

Result: 在数学数据集上训练的GRAD在Qwen2.5-14B上持续优于基线方法，在数学推理和STEM问题上表现出强大的泛化能力，并能用较小模型生成的演示有效指导较大模型。

Conclusion: GRAD引入了可扩展的演示生成器模型，为资源受限环境下的动态少样本学习范式迈出了第一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks,
but their effectiveness often depends on the quality of the provided context.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches prompts with external
information, but its reliance on static databases constrains adaptability and
can result in irrelevant demonstrations. In this work, we propose a Generative
Retrieval-Aligned Demonstrator (GRAD), a dynamic demonstration-based approach
where an LLM model is trained to generate input-specific concise
demonstrations. By tailoring demonstrations to each input, our method offers
better contextual support than traditional RAG approaches. We demonstrate the
superiority of GRAD under budget constraints, where we limit both the number of
tokens used per demonstration and the number of tokens used for the final
output. Trained solely on a math dataset, GRAD consistently outperforms strong
baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM
questions, highlighting GRAD's robust generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. Furthermore, we
show that demonstrations generated by trained smaller models can effectively
guide larger target models, reducing training costs while maintaining
competitive accuracy. Overall, this work introduces a scalable demonstration
generator model presenting the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning
paradigm in resource-constrained settings. We release the code used for the
project.

Motivation: 后训练对齐经常减少LLM的多样性，导致模式崩溃现象。与先前研究将这一现象归因于算法限制不同，本文识别了一个根本的、普遍存在的数据层面驱动因素：偏好数据中的典型性偏见。

Method: 提出言语化采样（VS），这是一种简单、无需训练的提示策略。VS提示模型对一组响应进行概率分布的语言化表达（例如“生成5个关于咖啡的笑话及其对应概率”）。

Result: 综合实验表明，VS在创意写作（诗歌、故事、笑话）、对话模拟、开放式问答和合成数据生成方面显著提升性能，在创意写作中多样性提高了1.6-2.1倍，且不牺牲事实准确性和安全性。更强大的模型从VS中获益更多。

Conclusion: 本文为模式崩溃提供了新的数据中心视角，并提出了一种实用的推理时补救措施，有助于释放预训练生成模型的多样性。

Abstract: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon
known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to
algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level
driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically
favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive
psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference
datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.
Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,
training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the
model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g.,
``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities'').
Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance
across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation,
open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual
accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity
by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that
more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new
data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy
that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

Motivation: 大语言模型需要持续更新以保持与现实世界知识的同步，但顺序编辑往往会导致表示不稳定和灾难性遗忘。研究发现超球面均匀性有助于模型保持稳定并保留先验知识。

Method: 使用超球面能量量化编辑过程中的神经元均匀性，提出SPHERE方法——识别预训练权重矩阵主超球面方向的互补稀疏空间，并将新知识投影到该空间，减少对主方向的扰动。

Result: 在LLaMA3和Qwen2.5上的实验表明，SPHERE在编辑能力上平均优于最佳基线16.41%，同时能最忠实地保持模型的通用性能。

Conclusion: SPHERE提供了一种原则性的路径，实现可靠的大规模知识编辑，通过稳定超球面能量来平衡知识更新与保留。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require constant updates to remain aligned with
evolving real-world knowledge. Model editing offers a lightweight alternative
to retraining, but sequential editing often destabilizes representations and
induces catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we seek to better understand and
mitigate performance degradation caused by sequential editing. We hypothesize
that hyperspherical uniformity, a property that maintains uniform distribution
of neuron weights on a hypersphere, helps the model remain stable, retain prior
knowledge, while still accommodate new updates. We use Hyperspherical Energy
(HE) to quantify neuron uniformity during editing, and examine its correlation
with editing performance. Empirical studies across widely used editing methods
reveals a strong correlation between HE dynamics and editing performance, with
editing failures consistently coinciding with high HE fluctuations. We further
theoretically prove that HE dynamics impose a lower bound on the degradation of
pretrained knowledge, highlighting why HE stability is crucial for knowledge
retention. Motivated by these insights, we propose SPHERE (Sparse Projection
for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing), an HE-driven regularization
strategy that stabilizes neuron weight distributions, ultimately preserving
prior knowledge while enabling reliable sequential updates. Specifically,
SPHERE identifies a sparse space complementary to the principal hyperspherical
directions of the pretrained weight matrices and projects new knowledge onto
it, attenuating perturbations on the principal directions. Extensive
experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show that SPHERE outperforms the
best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41%, while most
faithfully preserving general model performance, thereby offering a principled
path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing.
