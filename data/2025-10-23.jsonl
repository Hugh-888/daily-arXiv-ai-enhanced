See accompanying repository:\n  https://github.com/Giuhcs/Symmetric_Stabilizer_Extent_for_Unitaries", "summary": "Classical simulation of quantum circuits plays a crucial role in validating\nquantum hardware and delineating the boundaries of quantum advantage. Among the\nmost effective simulation techniques are those based on the stabilizer extent,\nwhich quantifies the overhead of representing non-Clifford operations as linear\ncombinations of Clifford unitaries. However, finding optimal decompositions\nrapidly becomes intractable as it constitutes a superexponentially large\noptimization problem. In this work, we exploit symmetries in the computation of\nthe stabilizer extent, proving that for real, diagonal, and real-diagonal\nunitaries, the optimization can be restricted to the corresponding subgroups of\nthe Clifford group without loss of optimality. This ``strong symmetry\nreduction'' drastically reduces computational cost, enabling optimal\ndecompositions of unitaries on up to seven qubits using a standard laptop--far\nbeyond previous two-qubit limits. Additionally, we employ a ``weak symmetry\nreduction'' method that leverages additional invariances to shrink the search\nspace further. Applying these results, we demonstrate exponential runtime\nimprovements in classical simulations of quantum Fourier transform circuits and\nmeasurement-based quantum computations on the Union Jack lattice, as well as\nnew insights into the non-stabilizer properties of multi-controlled-phase gates\nand unitaries generating hypergraph states. Our findings establish symmetry\nexploitation as a powerful route to scale classical simulation techniques and\ndeepen the resource-theoretic understanding of quantum advantage."}

For example, minor hyperparameter\nchanges, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants\ncan reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization\nmeasures like the path norm.

When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one\noften assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but\nperhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.\nThe task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this\n`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on\nwhat `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely\nsome discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently\nmonotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a\ncarefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of\nmonotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time\nand the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate\nfeatures which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed\nsystem is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two\nreal-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to\ncombine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high\nmonotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health\nmonitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute\nSpearman's $\\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with\nan absolute Spearman's $\\rho$ of $0.95$.

Together,\nthese limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many\nalignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies\nsacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.\nTo address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware\ngraph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive\nmany-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision\nquality.

Under a global compression ratio\nconstraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules\nbecomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms\nand mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.\nHowever, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic\nalgorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while\nmask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between\nsingular value spectra and trainable parameters.

In this work, we establish\n\\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online\nleast-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in\na \\emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional\ninference for projection parameters, such as~\\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on\ninverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \\gtrsim\nd^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,\nrendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable\ndimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates\nwhen the number of iterations grows as $t \\gtrsim d^{1+\\delta}$ for any $\\delta\n> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works\nwhile improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based\nprocedure operates in $\\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\\mathcal{O}(d)$\nmemory, in contrast to the $\\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of\ncovariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we\nfurther develop an \\emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance\nappearing in the CLT and establish \\emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for\nthis estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and\ndata-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in\nthe near-optimal scaling regime $t \\gtrsim d^{1+\\delta}$."}

Can Alice prove that Bob is using\nher model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from\nthe text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an\nindependence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model\nor text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it\nthrough the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are\nmore likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob\nis using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between\nBob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training\nrun. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant\ncorrelation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the\nnull hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the\nquery setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model\ngives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of\nover 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to\n12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value\non the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases.
