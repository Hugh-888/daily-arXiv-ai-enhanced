However, these gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) experiments rely on assumptions about subsystem independence. We sharpen the theoretical underpinnings of such proposals by examining them through the lens of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT), distinguishing distinct operational and algebraic notions of independence. We argue that state and measurement independence of subsystems, essential to the experimental logic, is nontrivial in the presence of gauge constraints and gravitational dressing. Using gravitationally dressed fields, we recall that commutation relations between spacelike separated observables are nontrivial, undermining strict Hilbert space factorization. We further explore the implications for entanglement witnesses, investigating the Tsirelson bound when subsystem algebras fail to commute, and showing that the Tsirelson bound persists for a suitably symmetrized CHSH observable even though the operational status of such \"joint\" observables becomes delicate when commensurability fails. Our analysis highlights how even within linearized covariant quantum gravity, violations of microcausality may affect both the interpretation, modelling, and design of proposed laboratory tests of quantum gravity, despite remaining negligible for current experimental regimes. Although we consider GIE-style protocols as a concrete case study, the subsystem-independence issues we highlight are generic to low-energy (perturbative) quantum gravity. Finally, we derive estimates for dressing-induced microcausality violations, which suggest a complementary avenue to current proposals: in principle, bounding dressing-induced microcausality violations themselves as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity."}

Squeezed light has also played a pivotal role in quantum information science with numerous applications in quantum computing and communication. Previously, squeezed light has been primarily generated using nonlinear optical interactions, where control of the degree of squeezing was possible by tuning the nonlinearity of the generating medium using suitable material engineering. Here, we modulate the third-order nonlinear response in dielectrics with strong ultrafast laser fields to control the degree of squeezing on attosecond time scales. We demonstrate the ability to change the ultrafast squeezed light generated in the nonlinear process from amplitude-squeezed to phase-squeezed by controlling the strong-field-driven nonlinear response of the material through a sub-cycle phase delay between the input femtosecond laser pulses. The squeezing of quantum noise is measured using a frequency-resolved balanced homodyne detection scheme capable of extracting the field quadratures in different frequency modes simultaneously. Using this frequency-resolved measurement we extract the complete coherency matrix containing the quantum correlations between field quadratures across different frequency modes of the femtosecond squeezed light pulse. These results have major implications for the development of quantum light sources with unprecedented levels of control over quadrature squeezing, for applications in multimode quantum information processing, and for measuring transient quantum matter correlations via transduction to quantum field correlations in an ultrafast light-matter interaction."}

Here we present a formal asymptotic derivation of the multigroup diffusion equation which addresses these differences, along with the varying and sometimes physically stringent assumptions employed in these works.\n  Further, we show a way to exactly invert the relationship between flux and current in the P1 approximation, giving a matricial expression for the multigroup diffusion coefficient which is formally exact, has clear physical meaning, and which can be easily computed to arbitrary precision on the basis of cross-section data already produced by lattice calculations. The resulting 2-group diffusion coefficient for an infinite medium of hydrogen is calculated with Monte Carlo, and compared to the those deriving from the Cumulative Migration Method and from the out-scatter approximation."}

While BTZ black holes are stable under standard Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, we demonstrate that they can develop instabilities when subjected to double-trace boundary conditions. Our key findings are threefold. First, we show that BTZ black holes exhibit instabilities not only for non-axisymmetric modes $\\unicode{x2013}$ previously the only known unstable sector $\\unicode{x2013}$ but crucially also for axisymmetric modes. Second, we prove that the axisymmetric instability is the dominant and most fundamental: configurations unstable to any non-axisymmetric mode are already unstable to the axisymmetric one. Third, we identify regions in the BTZ parameter space where these black holes are unstable while global AdS$_3$ remains stable, and we map the complete onset curves that determine the corresponding stability boundaries. Unlike conventional superradiant instabilities, the BTZ double-trace instability occurs for angular velocities always satisfying the Hawking-Reall bound. We trace the physical origin of these instabilities to the influx of energy and angular momentum through the asymptotic boundary permitted by double-trace deformations for a particular sign of the coupling, rather than to near-horizon effects. Our results provide a prototype for understanding double-trace instabilities in higher-dimensional rotating AdS black holes and suggest the existence of rotating hairy black hole solutions with scalar condensates, which we construct in a companion paper."}

At a high level, Dion2 selects a fraction of rows or columns at each iteration and orthonormalizes only those. This sampling procedure makes the update sparse, reducing both computation and communication costs which in turn improves the scalability of Muon."}

One of the most powerful nano-imaging methods is X-ray ptychography, a coherent diffraction imaging technique that has become the go-to method at synchrotron facilities for applications ranging from brain imaging to battery materials. However, the requirements in terms of X-ray beam quality have limited its use to large synchrotron facilities and, to date, only one attempt has been made to translate the technique to a small-scale laboratory. To unleash the power of this technique to the broad user community of laboratory X-ray sources, there are outstanding questions to answer including whether the quantitativeness of the information is preserved in a laboratory despite the drastic decrease in X-ray flux of several orders of magnitude, with respect to synchrotron instruments. In this study not only we demonstrate that the quantitativeness of X-ray ptychography is preserved in a laboratory setting, but we also apply the method to the imaging of a brain tissue phantom. Finally, we describe the current challenges and limitations, and we set the basis for further development and future directions of quantitative nano-imaging with laboratory X-ray sources."}

This project presents a low-cost, dual-mode neuro-muscular control system integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to enable real-time, multi-degree-of-freedom control of a prosthetic arm. EEG signals are acquired using the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 and transmitted via ThinkGear Bluetooth packets to an ESP32 microcontroller running a lightweight classification model. The model was trained on 1500 seconds of recorded EEG data using a 6-frame sliding window with low-pass filtering, excluding poor-signal samples and using a 70/20/10 training--validation--test split. The classifier detects strong blink events, which toggle the hand between open and closed states. EMG signals are acquired using a MyoWare 2.0 sensor and SparkFun wireless shield and transmitted to a second ESP32, which performs threshold-based detection. Three activation bands (rest: 0--T1; extension: T1--T2; contraction: greater than T2) enable intuitive elbow control, with movement triggered only after eight consecutive frames in a movement class to improve stability. The EEG-controlled ESP32 actuates four finger servos, while the EMG-controlled ESP32 drives two elbow servos. A functional prototype was constructed using low-cost materials (total cost approximately 240 dollars), with most expense attributed to the commercial EEG headset. Future work includes transitioning to a 3D-printed chassis, integrating auto-regressive models to reduce EMG latency, and upgrading servo torque for improved load capacity and grip strength.

In Starobinsky's seminal work and most of the subsequent literature, stochastic inflation is driven by a white noise. This is a consequence of a number of assumptions about the background metric, the window function, and the initial state. Given that noise is the central object in this approach, it is worthwhile to investigate how the noise is modified upon relaxing some of these assumptions. We show that while deviation from an exact de Sitter background maintains the white character of the noise (only with a time-dependent amplitude), deviation from the Heaviside window function or the Bunch-Davies initial state can produce colored noise. We calculate the power spectrum and the memory of the noise for a toy model with a piecewise linear window function. We also show that, in order to produce a colored noise, the deviation from the Bunch-Davies vacuum should essentially be a sum of two-particle states. The resulting noise is non-stationary and we find its instantaneous power spectrum in a concrete example. Furthermore, while deviations from de Sitter background and sharp cutoff do not affect Gaussianity, changing the initial state yields a non-Gaussian noise."}

Building on recent developments in kernelized PGM (KPGM) and direct PGM-based classifiers, this work presents a unified theoretical and empirical comparison of these paradigms. We analyze their performance across synthetic oversampling scenarios using Quantum SMOTE (QSMOTE) variants. Experimental results show that both PGM and KPGM classifiers consistently outperform a classical random forest baseline, particularly when multiple quantum copies are employed. Notably, PGM with stereo encoding and n_copies=2 achieves the highest overall accuracy (0.8512) and F1-score (0.8234), while KPGM demonstrates competitive and more stable behavior across QSMOTE variants, with top scores of 0.8511 (stereo) and 0.8483 (amplitude). These findings highlight that quantum-inspired classifiers not only provide tangible gains in recall and balanced performance but also offer complementary strengths: PGM benefits from encoding-specific enhancements, whereas KPGM ensures robustness across sampling strategies.

Current operational approaches rely on computationally intensive numerical weather prediction guidance and human-issued TAF products, which often exhibit conservative biases and limited temporal resolution. This study presents a lightweight gradient boosting framework (XGBoost) trained exclusively on surface observation data (METAR) and enhanced through physics-guided feature engineering based on thermodynamic principles. The framework is evaluated across 11 international airports representing distinct climatic regimes (including SCEL, KJFK, KORD, KDEN, SBGR, and VIDP) using historical data from 2000 to 2024. Results suggest that the model successfully captures underlying local physical processes without manual configuration. In a blind comparative evaluation against operational TAF forecasts, the automated model achieved substantially higher detection rates at tactical horizons (3 hours), with a 2.5 to 4.0 times improvement in recall while reducing false alarms. Furthermore, SHAP analysis reveals that the model performs an implicit reconstruction of local physical drivers (advection, radiation, and subsidence), providing actionable explainability for operational situational awareness.\n  Keywords: aviation meteorology; physics-guided machine learning; explainable artificial intelligence; lightweight machine learning; nowcasting; METAR; TAF verification; edge computing"}

To outperform the exponential transmission loss in optical fibers, quantum repeaters must employ multiplexing schemes in the temporal, spectral, or spatial domain. The performance of such a multiplexed scheme is contingent on efficient quantum memories offering both extended storage times and large multimode capacities. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate such a memory operating at telecom wavelength using an Er$^{3+}$:Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$ crystal. Using single-photon detectors, we record on-demand storage and recall of weak coherent pulses for up to $1$ ms, exceeding that of previously reported quantum memories based on Er$^{3+}$. The memory exhibits an efficiency of 10.36\\% at 300 $μ$s storage time with a signal-to-noise ratio of $10.9$. We further showcase its multimode capacity by storing 20 temporal and 3 spectral modes simultaneously with on-demand and selective recall capabilities, essential for a scalable quantum repeater architecture."}

To address these challenges, we investigate more stable and effective advantage estimation strategies, especially for multi-turn settings. We first explore Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as an alternative and find it to be more robust than GRPO. To further enhance PPO in multi-turn scenarios, we introduce turn-PPO, a variant that operates on a turn-level MDP formulation, as opposed to the commonly used token-level MDP.

We further provide a test criterion to determine whether the true underlying distribution is recoverable under per-sample information loss, and show that in otherwise unrecoverable cases, a small number of clean samples can render the distribution largely recoverable. Building on these insights, we introduce SFBD-OMNI, a bridge model-based framework that maps corrupted sample distributions to the ground-truth distribution. Our method generalizes Stochastic Forward-Backward Deconvolution (SFBD; Lu et al., 2025) to handle arbitrary measurement models beyond Gaussian corruption.

In this Letter, motivated by recent experimental advances, we investigate the universal dynamics of dissipative quantum systems with dipole moment conservation. We develop an effective field theory description, supported by a concrete quantum spin model, to capture the resulting universal behaviors. Our analysis unveils a novel strongly interacting non-equilibrium fixed point that governs the equal-time phase fluctuations in systems with either strong or weak dipole symmetries. Moreover, charge transport becomes subdiffusive in the presence of strong dipole symmetry, while it remains diffusive in the weakly symmetric case.

Starting from the most general kinetic terms and dimension four couplings between the 2-form field and the curvature tensors, we find a two-parameter family of such theories. However, we also find that parity-violating terms involving the dual 2-form field can be absorbed into a field redefinition, leaving a theory with essentially the same structure as that obtained by Heisenberg and Trenkler (i.e., the parity-preserving coupling to the double dual Riemann tensor). After the field redefinition, the only place where parity-violating terms can appear is in the potential. We then consider a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with an isotropic configuration of a triplet of 2-form fields, and study tensor perturbations in this setup. There are three types of tensor perturbations, two of which are dynamical. We show that chiral gravitational waves can be generated in the presence of parity-violating terms in the potential."}

This limitation often introduces irrelevant tools that mislead the agent, degrading efficiency and accuracy. We propose Dynamic Tool Dependency Retrieval (DTDR), a lightweight retrieval method that conditions on both the initial query and the evolving execution context. DTDR models tool dependencies from function calling demonstrations, enabling adaptive retrieval as plans unfold. We benchmark DTDR against state-of-the-art retrieval methods across multiple datasets and LLM backbones, evaluating retrieval precision, downstream task accuracy, and computational efficiency.

The spacetime geometry, characterized by the BH mass and the coupling parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$, includes exponential and oscillatory corrections arising from the Lee-Wick terms. Using the effective potential approach, we derive specific energy, angular momentum, epicyclic frequencies, and the locations of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of test particles. In addition to the analytical analysis, we explore the effects of the Lee-Wick spacetime parameters on the shock-cone morphology produced by Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion. To this end, we perform general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations in two characteristic regimes: Block-1 (weak Lee-Wick regime) and Block-2 (strong Lee-Wick regime). The results show that Block-1 solutions closely resemble the Schwarzschild case, while Block-2 models develop denser and asymmetric shock cones accompanied by stronger QPOs activity, shifting from low-frequency to high-frequency QPOs. These variations yield distinct observational signatures that may be detectable in high-resolution X-ray timing data. Our analytical and numerical findings demonstrate that the Lee-Wick parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$ cause measurable changes in the morphology of the accretion flow and in the frequency ratios near the BH. This suggests that future multi-wavelength observations could provide an important avenue to test higher-derivative gravity theories."}

Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward. Our Mixed-CoT-RL model matches standard RL on clean problems (41% vs 41%) while substantially outperforming it on problems prefilled with flawed reasoning (24% vs 19%). Notably, clean-only RL fine-tuning degrades robustness below the untuned baseline 19% vs. 20%), indicating that conventional training increases susceptibility to misleading prefills. Among error types, training on reasoning errors yields greater robustness gains than calculation errors alone, with mixed training performing best.

However, these canonical forms do not apply to circuits, as they can represent factorizations that do not directly map to a known TN. Inspired by the ideas of orthogonality in canonical forms and determinism in circuits enabling tractable maximization, we show how to parameterize squared circuits to overcome their marginalization overhead.

In a different direction, the Kaluza-Klein proposal aims to recover gauge symmetries by means of dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional gravitational theories. Integrating both, gravitational and gauge degrees of freedom in $3+1$ dimensions may be obtained upon dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional emergent gravity. To this end, we show that entangled systems of two and three qubits can be associated with $5+1$ and $9+1$ dimensional spacetimes respectively, which are reduced to $3+1$ dimensions upon singling out a preferred complex direction. In the latter case, this reduction is invariant under a residual $SU(3) \\times SU(2) \\times U(1) /\\mathbb{Z}_6$ symmetry, the Standard Model gauge group. This motivates a picture in which spacetime emerges from the area law-contribution to the entanglement entropy, while gauge and matter degrees of freedom are due to area law-violating terms. We remark on a possible natural origin of the chirality of the weak force in the given construction. Furthermore, we highlight the possibility of using this construction in quantum simulations of Standard Model fields."}

Whilst much of the post-discovery literature has focused on its astrophysical origins, primary analyses have exhibited considerable discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models, which cannot reliably be reproduced by simulations. Such discrepancies may arise when an unaccounted overlapping signal is present in the data, or from phenomena that produce similar effects, such as gravitational lensing or overlapping noise artifacts. In this work, we analyse GW231123 using a flexible model that allows for two overlapping signals, and find that it is favoured over the isolated signal model with Bayes factors of $\\sim 10^2 - 10^{4}$, depending on the waveform model. These values lie within the top few per cent of the background distribution. Similar effects are not observed in GW190521, another high-mass event. Under the overlapping signals model, discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models are largely mitigated, and the two recovered sources show similar properties. Additionally, we find that neglecting an additional signal in overlapping-signal data can lead to discrepancies in the estimated source properties resembling those reported in GW231123."}

The resulting adaptive process leverages further MPPI exploration where value estimates are uncertain, and improves training robustness and the overall resulting policies. This results in a robust planning approach that can handle complex planning problems and easily adapts to different applications, as demonstrated over several domains, including race driving, modified Acrobot, and Lunar Lander with added obstacles. Our results in these domains show better data efficiency and overall performance in terms of both rewards and task success, with up to a 72% increase in success rate compared to existing approaches, as well as accelerated convergence (x2.1) compared to non-adaptive sampling."}

Using the near-horizon Rindler correspondence, we derive analytic expressions for the logarithmic negativity and mutual information and examine their dependence on detector position, frequency, and Lorentz-violation parameters. Despite sharing the same metric, the two Lorentz-violating vacua become distinguishable near the horizon, particularly at low frequencies. We analyze the excitation of a freely falling two-level atom coupled to quantum fields near the horizon. The associated acceleration-radiation transition probabilities are computed explicitly. The resulting atomic response is locally indistinguishable from that in flat spacetime, confirming the validity of the equivalence principle even in the presence of Lorentz-violating corrections. Finally, we extend the notion of horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy to the bumblebee black hole and derive the corresponding entropy production rate induced by infalling atoms."}

However, their black-box nature limits trust and adoption, especially in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. To address this challenge, we introduce UniCoMTE, a model-agnostic framework for generating counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series classifiers. The framework identifies temporal features that most heavily influence a model's prediction by modifying the input sample and assessing its impact on the model's prediction. UniCoMTE is compatible with a wide range of model architectures and operates directly on raw time series inputs. In this study, we evaluate UniCoMTE's explanations on a time series ECG classifier. We quantify explanation quality by comparing our explanations' comprehensibility to comprehensibility of established techniques (LIME and SHAP) and assessing their generalizability to similar samples. Furthermore, clinical utility is assessed through a questionnaire completed by medical experts who review counterfactual explanations presented alongside original ECG samples. Results show that our approach produces concise, stable, and human-aligned explanations that outperform existing methods in both clarity and applicability. By linking model predictions to meaningful signal patterns, the framework advances the interpretability of deep learning models for real-world time series applications."}

The proposed DFFSM accurately models I-V characteristics under multiple faults and provides analytical gradients with respect to fault parameters. Leveraging this property, a gradient-based fault parameters identification (GFPI) method using the Adahessian optimizer is developed to efficiently quantify partial shading, short-circuit, and series-resistance degradation. Experimental results on both simulated and measured I-V curves demonstrate that the proposed GFPI achieves high quantification accuracy across different faults, with the I-V reconstruction error below 3%, confirming the feasibility and effectiveness of the application of differentiable physical simulators for PV system fault diagnosis."}

We explore the critical scattering dynamics associated with these singularities, and attribute the persistent wave emission to the existence of a stationary bound state in the continuum. Due to the presence of this bound state, the conventional time-independent scattering theory proves inadequate for such a non-Hermitian system.

However, in this paper, we will show that this monotonicity is not universally valid. By deriving a universal, ensemble-independent criterion for $\\mathrm{d}r_{\\rm c}/\\mathrm{d}r_h$ and applying it to the $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordström-Anti-de Sitter black hole, we reveal a sharp dichotomy: while $r_{\\rm c}(r_h)$ exhibits strictly monotonicity along isobars, it typically becomes non-monotonic along isotherms (except for the photon sphere of Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black hole)--a behavior that has been overlooked in previous studies. Nevertheless, we rigorously prove that within the phase-transition region itself, the monotonicity of $r_{\\rm c}(r_h)$ is preserved. However, the generalizability of this result to other spacetimes requires case-by-case verification, and its validity could have notable implications for the observability of the jump in $r_{\\rm c}$.

Furthermore, we show that the critical exponents extracted from $r_{\\rm c}$ match those obtained from $r_h$, independent of ensemble.

Trugenberger"], "title": "Networks as the fundamental constituents of the universe", "comment": null, "summary": "We review an approach that uses binary relations as the fundamental constituents of the universe, utilizing them as building blocks for both space and matter. The model is defined by an ultraviolet continuous fixed point of a statistical model on random networks, governed by the combinatorial Ollivier-Ricci curvature, which acts as a network analogue of the Einstein-Hilbert action. The model exhibits two distinct phases separated by this fixed point, a geometric and a random phase, representing space and matter, respectively. At weak coupling and on large scales, the network organizes into a holographic surface whose collective state encodes both an emergent 3D space and the matter distributed in it. The Einstein equations emerge as constitutive relations expressing matter in terms of fundamental network degrees of freedom while dynamics in a comoving frame is governed by relativistic quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics, however is an effective theory breaking down at the scale of the radius of curvature of the holographic network. On smaller scales, not only relativistic invariance is lost but also the Lorentzian signature of space-time. Finally, the manifold nature of space-time breaks down on the Planck length, where the random character of the fundamental network on the smallest scales becomes apparent. The network model seems to naturally encode several of the large-distance features of cosmology, albeit still at a qualitative level. The holographic property of black holes arises intrinsically from the expander nature of random regular graphs. There is a natural mechanism to resolve the cosmological constant problem and dark matter appears naturally as a metastable allotrope in the network fabric of space-time. In this model, both gravity and quantum mechanics are macroscopic statistical effects reflecting the free energy minimization of fundamental binary degrees of freedom."}

The proposed method achieves memory efficiency comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while accumulating task saliency scores that enable curvature-aware merging without post-hoc Fisher computation. We establish convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives with approximation error bounded by gradient singular value decay. On natural language understanding benchmarks, curvature-aware parameter selection outperforms magnitude-only baselines across all sparsity levels, with multi-task merging improving over strong baselines.

Because complementing $f$ changes the state $|ψ\\rangle$ only by a global phase, hypotheses $p$ and $1-p$ are information-theoretically identical in this model; thus the natural discriminand is the phase-bias magnitude $|μ|$ (equivalently $μ^2$).

While previous studies demonstrated that the higher-order WKB method can also be used for Kerr BHs in GR, there has been little work on rotating BHs in modified theories of gravity.

Using this universal entropy formula, a compact expression for the GSL is derived. This formalism is then applied to some viable $f(T)$ and $f(R)$ gravity models, in order to re-evaluate the validity of the GSL as a function of redshift. The analysis demonstrates that including the integral term in the revisited entropy can relatively improve the late-time validity of the GSL for some of these models while living others unchanged, thereby reinforcing the profound connection between thermodynamics and gravity."}

How such distributed control gives rise to precise global patterns remains a central question not only in developmental biology but also in distributed robotics, programmable matter, and multi-agent learning. Here, we introduce DiffeoMorph, an end-to-end differentiable framework for learning a morphogenesis protocol that guides a population of agents to morph into a target 3D shape. Each agent updates its position and internal state using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, based on its own internal state and signals received from other agents. To train this system, we introduce a new shape-matching loss based on the 3D Zernike polynomials, which compares the predicted and target shapes as continuous spatial distributions, not as discrete point clouds, and is invariant to agent ordering, number of agents, and rigid-body transformations. To enforce full SO(3) invariance -- invariant to rotations yet sensitive to reflections, we include an alignment step that optimally rotates the predicted Zernike spectrum to match the target before computing the loss. This results in a bilevel problem, with the inner loop optimizing a unit quaternion for the best alignment and the outer loop updating the agent model. We compute gradients through the alignment step using implicit differentiation. We perform systematic benchmarking to establish the advantages of our shape-matching loss over other standard distance metrics for shape comparison tasks. We then demonstrate that DiffeoMorph can form a range of shapes -- from simple ellipsoids to complex morphologies -- using only minimal spatial cues."}

Analytical solutions of the optical Bloch equations under steady-state conditions show that the induced torque and resulting rotational motion exhibit high sensitivity to phase variations. We show that the DT system coherently reconfigures into either coupled Λ or double-Λ schemes depending on the relative phases, with each configuration exhibiting distinct quantized torque characteristics.

The presence of a companion can dramatically impact both the cloud's evolution and the binary's orbital dynamics, generating a trail of feedback effects that require detailed modelling. Using a worldline effective field theory approach, we develop a systematic framework for binaries on generic (eccentric and inclined) orbits, capturing both resonant and non-resonant transitions without relying solely on balance laws. We demonstrate the existence of ``co-rotating'' floating orbits that can deplete the cloud prior to entering the detector's band, triggering eccentricity growth towards a sequence of fixed points. Likewise, we show that ``counter-rotating'' orbits can also deplete the cloud, driving (unbounded) growth of eccentricity. Furthermore, we uncover novel features tied to orbital inclination. Depending on the mass ratio, equatorial orbits can become unstable, and fixed points may arise not only for aligned or anti-aligned configurations but, strikingly, also at intermediate inclinations. We derive flow equations governing spin-orbit misalignment and eccentricity and identify distinctive signatures that can reveal the presence of boson clouds in the binary's history, as well as key features of possible in-band transitions. These results refine and extend earlier work, yielding a more faithful description of the imprints of ultralight particles in gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes, signatures that are within reach of future detectors such as LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and the Einstein~Telescope."}

These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload.

To this end, equations of motion for Bloch components are derived from the von Neumann equation, which are mathematically equivalent to equations of motion for a distribution of point masses from classical mechanics. Furthermore, using the Heisenberg equation, another system of Bloch vector equations is derived, which forms an Euler-Poinsot system, as is commonly encountered in the theory of torque-free spinning tops. This is used to prove the Liouville integrability of the corresponding Hamilton equations of motion, whereby formal connections to the Neumann model of classical Hamiltonian dynamics and the Hamiltonian Euler-Poinsot model are drawn to identify the first integrals of motion. Within the same framework, stability criteria for quantum dynamics are then derived which correspond to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion resp. other criteria following from the Energy-Casimir method of classical Newtonian mechanics. Following that, specific solutions to the equations of motion are constructed that encode the complex dynamics of composite quantum systems. Eventually, to show that this formalism provides concrete physical predictions, an analogue of the intermediate axis theorem is derived and the effect of oscillating entanglement is discussed. As a basis for this, special types of solutions to the equations of motion are derived that constitute oscillating entangled states, i.e., dynamical quantum states that change their entanglement structure from maximally entangled to separable and vice versa."}

We consider wireless networks where L cells share S orthogonal channels and cannot simultaneously use the same channel as their neighbors. Each channel evolves as an unknown restless Markov process with cell-dependent rewards, making this the first work to establish global Gale-Shapley stability for channel allocation in a stochastic, temporally varying restless environment. To address this challenge, we develop SMILE (Stable Multi-matching with Interference-aware LEarning), a communication-efficient distributed learning algorithm that integrates restless bandit learning with graph-constrained coordination. SMILE enables cells to distributedly balance exploration of unknown channels with exploitation of learned information.

We demonstrate that a simple kernel ridge regression (KRR) framework, when combined with a dynamics-aware validation strategy, provides a strong baseline for long-term prediction of complex dynamical systems. By employing a data-driven kernel derived from diffusion maps, the proposed Diffusion Maps Kernel Ridge Regression (DM-KRR) method implicitly adapts to the intrinsic geometry of the system's invariant set, without requiring explicit manifold reconstruction or attractor modeling, procedures that often limit predictive performance. Across a broad range of systems, including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, DM-KRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art random feature, neural-network and operator-learning methods in both accuracy and data efficiency. These findings underscore that long-term predictive skill depends not only on model expressiveness, but critically on respecting the geometric constraints encoded in the data through dynamically consistent model selection. Together, simplicity, geometry awareness, and strong empirical performance point to a promising path for reliable and efficient learning of complex dynamical systems."}

This paper proposes the concept of frequency-multiplexed millimeter-wave superconducting qubits and demonstrates a novel architecture that integrates an on-chip cryogenic nonreciprocal space-time-periodic superconducting frequency multiplier as a universal control bus for a frequency-multiplexed qubit array. The bus replaces multiple high-frequency XY drive lines with a single low-frequency input tone, which the multiplier converts into a comb of high-order harmonics, each resonantly addressing a distinct qubit. Crucially, the dynamic and nonreciprocal nature of the bus provides signal gain and intrinsic isolation that simultaneously suppresses Purcell decay, enhancing T1 times across all distinct-frequency qubits, and reduces coherent crosstalk by more than two orders of magnitude. The spatiotemporal modulation enables parametric frequency multiplication and creates wave-propagation dynamics analogous to cosmological expansion, with observed redshift-like broadening and deceleration of magnetic-field wavepackets. Theoretical modeling based on a non-Markovian master equation confirms that the engineered memory kernel extends coherence while reshaping the noise spectrum. Full error-budget analysis shows that the architecture maintains gate errors below the fault-tolerance threshold for arrays exceeding 25 qubits, converting a crosstalk-dominated error budget into one limited by intrinsic material coherence. This integrated, frequency-multiplexed, and nonreciprocal control bus therefore offers a path toward unprecedented I/O simplification, noise resilience, and scalable high-coherence quantum processin"}

However, real-world QoS data are extremely sparse, noisy, and shaped by hierarchical dependencies arising from QoS interactions, and geographical and network-level factors, making accurate QoS prediction challenging. Existing methods often predict each QoS parameter separately, requiring multiple similar models, which increases computational cost and leads to poor generalization. Although recent joint QoS prediction studies have explored shared architectures, they suffer from negative transfer due to loss-scaling caused by inconsistent numerical ranges across QoS parameters and further struggle with inadequate representation learning, resulting in degraded accuracy. This paper presents an unified strategy for joint QoS prediction, called SHARP-QoS, that addresses these issues using three components. First, we introduce a dual mechanism to extract the hierarchical features from both QoS and contextual structures via hyperbolic convolution formulated in the Poincaré ball. Second, we propose an adaptive feature-sharing mechanism that allows feature exchange across informative QoS and contextual signals. A gated feature fusion module is employed to support dynamic feature selection among structural and shared representations. Third, we design an EMA-based loss balancing strategy that allows stable joint optimization, thereby mitigating the negative transfer. Evaluations on three datasets with two, three, and four QoS parameters demonstrate that SHARP-QoS outperforms both single- and multi-task baselines. Extensive study shows that our model effectively addresses major challenges, including sparsity, robustness to outliers, and cold-start, while maintaining moderate computational overhead, underscoring its capability for reliable joint QoS prediction."}

Prior work has attempted to extend BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of well-established mathematical properties has limited further theoretical analysis between MDPs. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) for measuring state similarity between arbitrary pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with three fundamental metric properties, i.e., GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and a distance bound on identical spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyze policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation across MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than existing ones derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM.

To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation.

The learning is guarded by a lightweight nonlocal consistency loss term to enforce coherence between the learned operator and reconstructed solution. The MINPO formulation allows to naturally capture and efficiently resolve nonlocal spatiotemporal dependencies governed by a wide spectrum of IDEs and their subsets, including fractional PDEs. We evaluate the efficacy of MINPO in comparison with classical techniques and state-of-the-art neural-based strategies based on MLPs, such as A-PINN and fPINN, along with their newly-developed KAN variants, A-PIKAN and fPIKAN, designed to facilitate a fair comparison. Our study offers compelling evidence of the accuracy of MINPO and demonstrates its robustness in handling (i) diverse kernel types, (ii) different kernel dimensionalities, and (iii) the substantial computational demands arising from repeated evaluations of kernel integrals. MINPO, thus, generalizes beyond problem-specific formulations, providing a unified framework for systems governed by nonlocal operators."}

In continuous-variable platforms, inseparability tests based on Gaussian statistics - such as those of Duan and Simon - fail when quantum correlations are encoded in higher moments of the field quadratures. Here we introduce an inseparability criterion that exposes non-Gaussian entanglement that escapes covariance-based criteria by incorporating higher-order quadrature cumulants. The criterion extends Gaussian theory without requiring full state tomography and can be evaluated directly from homodyne and heterodyne data and is possible to extend to arbitrary superpositions of Fock states in two modes. This provides an experimentally viable approach for identifying non-Gaussian resources in continuous-variable platforms."}

We introduce Multi view Adaptive Transport Clustering for Heterogeneous Alzheimer's Disease (MATCH-AD), a semi supervised framework that integrates deep representation learning, graph-based label propagation, and optimal transport theory to address this limitation. The framework leverages manifold structure in neuroimaging data to propagate diagnostic information from limited labeled samples to larger unlabeled populations, while using Wasserstein distances to quantify disease progression between cognitive states. Evaluated on nearly five thousand subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, encompassing structural MRI measurements from hundreds of brain regions, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and clinical variables MATCHAD achieves near-perfect diagnostic accuracy despite ground truth labels for less than one-third of subjects. The framework substantially outperforms all baseline methods, achieving kappa indicating almost perfect agreement compared to weak agreement for the best baseline, a qualitative transformation in diagnostic reliability. Performance remains clinically useful even under severe label scarcity, and we provide theoretical convergence guarantees with proven bounds on label propagation error and transport stability.

However, there is not a consistent definition or test to demonstrate inherent explainability.

The criterion uses graph theory for representing and decomposing models for structure-local explanation, and recomposing them into global explanations. We form the structure-local explanations as annotations, a verifiable hypothesis-evidence structure that allows for a range of explanatory methods to be used. This criterion matches existing intuitions on inherent explainability, and provides justifications why a large regression model may not be explainable but a sparse neural network could be. We differentiate explainable -- a model that allows for explanation -- and \\textit{explained} -- one that has a verified explanation. Finally, we provide a full explanation of PREDICT -- a Cox proportional hazards model of cardiovascular disease risk, which is in active clinical use in New Zealand. It follows that PREDICT is inherently explainable. This work provides structure to formalise other work on explainability, and allows regulators a flexible but rigorous test that can be used in compliance frameworks."}

Through activation patching experiments across 9 models from 7 Transformer families plus Mamba (370M-13B parameters), we establish three key findings:\n  1. Double dissociation: Task Schema transfers at 100% via late MLP patching; Binding transfers at 62% via residual stream patching -- proving separable mechanisms\n  2. Prior-Schema trade-off: Schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28 task-model pairs)\n  3. Architecture generality: The mechanism operates across all tested architectures including the non-Transformer Mamba\n  These findings offer a mechanistic account of the ICL puzzle that contrasts with prior views treating ICL as a monolithic mechanism (whether retrieval-based, gradient descent-like, or purely Bayesian). By establishing that Schema and Binding are neurally dissociable -- not merely behavioral modes -- we provide causal evidence for dual-process theories of ICL. Models rely on Task Schema when prior knowledge is absent, but prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) rather than direct output competition (0%). This explains why arbitrary mappings succeed (zero prior leads to full Schema reliance) while factual overrides fail -- and reveals that the true bottleneck is attentional, not output-level. Practical implications: Understanding these dual mechanisms enables more efficient prompt engineering -- reliable schema transfer reduces required demonstrations for novel tasks, while prior-aware design can mitigate the 38% binding failure rate in high-prior scenarios, improving ICL system reliability in production deployments."}

While continuum limits of two state quantum walks are well established, an explicit continuous spacetime formulation for the lazy three state walk, particularly including noise, has not previously been constructed. Using an SU(3) representation of a Grover type coin together with a Lindblad formulation of decoherence acting either on the coin or the spatial subspace, we systematically expand the discrete dynamics in both space and time to obtain continuum master equations governing the coarse grained evolution. The resulting generators yield a genuine partial differential equation description of the walk, going beyond purely probabilistic or spectral correspondences. We show that the unitary limit is governed by a Dirac-type SU(3) Hamiltonian describing ballistic advection of left and right moving modes coupled by local symmetric mixing, with the rest state acting as an additional internal degree of freedom. Coin dephasing selectively damps internal coherences while preserving coherent spatial transport, whereas spatial dephasing suppresses long range spatial interference and rapidly drives the dynamics toward classical behaviour. This continuum framework clarifies how internal symmetry, rest state coupling, and distinct decoherence channels shape large scale transport in lazy open quantum walks, and provides a foundation for future extensions toward multichannel quantum transport models and quantum-inspired algorithms."}

To address this, we propose an adaptive pruning algorithm that dynamically filters redundant neighbour features while preserving the most informative spatial context for prediction. The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Sudden Event Prediction Accuracy (SEPA), a novel event-focused metric designed to measure responsiveness to traffic slowdowns and recoveries, which are often missed by standard error metrics. We evaluate our approach in an online semi-decentralized setting with traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning on two large-scale traffic datasets, PeMS-BAY and PeMSD7-M, across short-, mid-, and long-term prediction horizons. Experiments show that, in contrast to standard metrics, SEPA exposes the true value of spatial connectivity in predicting dynamic and irregular traffic. Our adaptive pruning algorithm maintains prediction accuracy while significantly lowering communication cost in all online semi-decentralized settings, demonstrating that communication can be reduced without compromising responsiveness to critical traffic events."}

Machine learning (ML) models are widely adopted to detect such content; however, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, wherein malicious users subtly modify text to evade detection. Enhancing adversarial robustness is therefore essential, requiring detectors that can defend against diverse attacks (generalizability) while maintaining high overall accuracy. However, simultaneously achieving both optimal generalizability and accuracy is challenging. Following the computational design science paradigm, this study takes a sequential approach that first proposes a novel framework (Large Language Model-based Sample Generation and Aggregation, LLM-SGA) by identifying the key invariances of textual adversarial attacks and leveraging them to ensure that a detector instantiated within the framework has strong generalizability. Second, we instantiate our detector (Adversarially Robust Harmful Online Content Detector, ARHOCD) with three novel design components to improve detection accuracy: (1) an ensemble of multiple base detectors that exploits their complementary strengths; (2) a novel weight assignment method that dynamically adjusts weights based on each sample's predictability and each base detector's capability, with weights initialized using domain knowledge and updated via Bayesian inference; and (3) a novel adversarial training strategy that iteratively optimizes both the base detectors and the weight assignor. We addressed several limitations of existing adversarial robustness enhancement research and empirically evaluated ARHOCD across three datasets spanning hate speech, rumor, and extremist content. Results show that ARHOCD offers strong generalizability and improves detection accuracy under adversarial conditions."}

We consider a one-dimensional mixed-field Ising model, as well as a chain of Rydberg atoms, and compare numerical calculations and experimental results for the end-to-end transfer error with different schedule functions. We show, in particular, that if the time dependent Hamiltonian is $n$ times differentiable with vanishing $1^{st}$ to $n^{th}$ order derivatives in the beginning and in the end, the infidelity with respect to the final adiabatic eigenstate scales as $1/T^{n+1}$ when evolving for time $T$."}

We show that these judge systems exhibit a recurring vulnerability: short sequences of low-perplexity control tokens can flip many binary evaluations from correct ``No'' judgments to incorrect ``Yes'' judgments by steering the last-layer logit gap. These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks. Finally, we show that LoRA-based adversarial training on small sets of control-token-augmented examples can markedly reduce these false positives while preserving evaluation quality."}

To characterize the resulting state, we use a single-shot f-2f interferometer to sample its Husimi function. We observe a clear transformation from a 2D Gaussian distribution to an 'S'-shaped non-Gaussian profile, which is the direct statistical evidence of the intensity-dependent nonlinear phase. The negativity of the Wigner function, which is an intrinsic property of any pure non-Gaussian state, cannot be observed because BSV is a mixed state even under minute optical loss. However, we show that BSV can be considered as a mixture of pure squeezed coherent states, for some of which Kerr-induced Wigner-function negativity is quite tolerant to loss. This work bridges the gap between quantum optics and ultrafast nonlinear optics, opening a path to quantum applications that require high photon flux."}

Although Inconel 625 shows excellent creep resistance, finite-element creep simulations in tools such as ANSYS remain computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes for a single 10,000-hour run. This work proposes deep learning based surrogate models to provide fast and accurate replacements for such simulations. Creep strain data was generated in ANSYS using the Norton law under uniaxial stresses of 50 to 150 MPa and temperatures of 700 to 1000 $^\\circ$C, and this temporal dataset was used to train two architectures: a BiLSTM Variational Autoencoder for uncertainty-aware and generative predictions, and a BiLSTM Transformer hybrid that employs self-attention to capture long-range temporal behavior. Both models act as surrogate predictors, with the BiLSTM-VAE offering probabilistic output and the BiLSTM-Transformer delivering high deterministic accuracy. Performance is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and $R^2$. Results show that the BiLSTM-VAE provides stable and reliable creep strain forecasts, while the BiLSTM-Transformer achieves strong accuracy across the full time range. Latency tests indicate substantial speedup: while each ANSYS simulation requires 30 to 40 minutes for a given stress-temperature condition, the surrogate models produce predictions within seconds.

By sweeping a rotation angle, we compute quantum Fisher information and Fubini-Study distances to quantify how the rotated wavefunction moves within the loss landscape. Shallow architectures (with focus on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)) trained with quantum natural gradient are more likely to fall into saddle-point regions depending on the rotation angle: they achieve low energy error but fail to reproduce correct coefficient distributions. In the ferromagnetic case, near-degenerate eigenstates create high-curvature barriers that trap optimization at intermediate fidelities. We introduce a framework based on an analytically solvable rotated Ising model to investigate how relocating the target wavefunction within a fixed loss landscape exposes information-geometric barriers,such as saddle points and high-curvature regions,that hinder shallow NQS optimization, underscoring the need for landscape-aware model design in variational training."}

This paper introduces Collaborative Forward-Forward (CFF) learning, extending the original algorithm through inter-layer cooperation mechanisms that preserve forward-only computation while enabling global context integration. Our framework implements two collaborative paradigms: Fixed CFF (F-CFF) with constant inter-layer coupling and Adaptive CFF (A-CFF) with learnable collaboration parameters that evolve during training. The collaborative goodness function incorporates weighted contributions from all layers, enabling coordinated feature learning while maintaining memory efficiency and biological plausibility. Comprehensive evaluation on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline Forward-Forward implementations.

This dual objective creates a fundamental tension, as overly conservative policies limit driving efficiency while aggressive exploration risks safety violations. The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework addresses this challenge by equipping agents with a predictive model of future constraint violations and has shown promise in controlled environments. This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements. However, its effectiveness depends on the underlying policy optimizer and the dataset distribution. The results further show that predictive safety representations play a critical role in improving robustness to observation noise. Additionally, in zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation, SRPL-augmented agents demonstrate improved generalization compared to non-SRPL methods. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential of predictive safety representations to strengthen SafeRL for autonomous driving."}

In some settings, like in the medical domain, data is often fragmented across parties, and cannot be readily shared. While federated learning addresses this situation, it is a solution that requires synchronicity of parties training a single model together, exchanging information about model weights. We investigate how asynchronous collaboration, where only already trained models are shared (e.g. as part of a publication), affects performance, and propose to use stitching as a method for combining models.\n  Through taking a multi-objective perspective, where performance on each parties' data is viewed independently, we find that training solely on a single parties' data results in similar performance when merging with another parties' data, when considering performance on that single parties' data, while performance on other parties' data is notably worse. Moreover, while an ensemble of such individually trained networks generalizes better, performance on each parties' own dataset suffers.

To address this issue, we develop a hybrid strategy that combines the strengths of hard and easy prioritization through an alternating training algorithm.

We address this inefficiency with TRAPO (\\textbf{T}rust-\\textbf{R}egion \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization), a hybrid framework that interleaves SFT and RL within each training instance by optimizing SFT loss on expert prefixes and RL loss on the model's own completions, unifying external supervision and self-exploration. To stabilize training, we introduce Trust-Region SFT (TrSFT), which minimizes forward KL divergence inside a trust region but attenuates optimization outside, effectively shifting toward reverse KL and yielding stable, mode-seeking updates favorable for RL. An adaptive prefix-selection mechanism further allocates expert guidance based on measured utility. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that TRAPO consistently surpasses standard SFT, RL, and SFT-then-RL pipelines, as well as recent state-of-the-art approaches, establishing a strong new paradigm for reasoning-enhanced LLMs."}

For the polyharmonic cascade, a training method alternative to gradient descent is proposed: instead of directly optimizing the coefficients, one solves a single global linear system on each batch with respect to the function values at fixed \"constellations\" of nodes. This yields synchronized updates of all layers, preserves the probabilistic interpretation of individual layers and theoretical consistency with the original model, and scales well: all computations reduce to 2D matrix operations efficiently executed on a GPU. Fast learning without overfitting on MNIST is demonstrated."}

However, most existing feature selection approaches either operate as multi-stage pipelines or rely on post hoc feature attribution, making selection and prediction weakly coupled. In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps. We evaluate YOTO on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that sparse, end-to-end, multi-task gene subset selection improves predictive performance and yields compact and meaningful gene subsets, advancing biomarker discovery and single-cell analysis."}

While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks. Furthermore, rigorous statistical validation confirms that the proposed method delivers not only superior predictive accuracy but also well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts, effectively bridging the gap between physics-aware modeling and data-driven learning."}

Our approach estimates the model's confidence in each parameter and constrains updates in high-curvature directions, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient target-domain learning. By applying the Laplace approximation only to the LoRA weights, the method remains lightweight. We evaluate LaLoRA by fine-tuning a Llama model for mathematical reasoning and demonstrate an improved learning-forgetting trade-off, which can be directly controlled via the method's regularization strength. We further explore different loss landscape curvature approximations for estimating parameter confidence, analyze the effect of the data used for the Laplace approximation, and study robustness across hyperparameters."}

To systematically address this, we introduce ECHO (Evaluating Communication over long HOps), a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess the capabilities of GNNs in handling very long-range graph propagation. ECHO includes three synthetic graph tasks, namely single-source shortest paths, node eccentricity, and graph diameter, each constructed over diverse and structurally challenging topologies intentionally designed to introduce significant information bottlenecks. ECHO also includes two real-world datasets, ECHO-Charge and ECHO-Energy, which define chemically grounded benchmarks for predicting atomic partial charges and molecular total energies, respectively, with reference computations obtained at the density functional theory (DFT) level. Both tasks inherently depend on capturing complex long-range molecular interactions. Our extensive benchmarking of popular GNN architectures reveals clear performance gaps, emphasizing the difficulty of true long-range propagation and highlighting design choices capable of overcoming inherent limitations. ECHO thereby sets a new standard for evaluating long-range information propagation, also providing a compelling example for its need in AI for science."}

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical approach for effectively adapting LMs to a diverse range of downstream tasks. However, existing PEFT methods face two primary challenges: (1) High resource cost. Although PEFT methods significantly reduce resource demands compared to full fine-tuning, it still requires substantial time and memory, making it impractical in resource-constrained environments. (2) Parameter dependency. PEFT methods heavily rely on updating a subset of parameters associated with LMs to incorporate task-specific knowledge. Yet, due to increasing competition in the LMs landscape, many companies have adopted closed-source policies for their leading models, offering access only via Application Programming Interface (APIs). Whereas, the expense is often cost-prohibitive and difficult to sustain, as the fine-tuning process of LMs is extremely slow. Even if small models perform far worse than LMs in general, they can achieve superior results on particular distributions while requiring only minimal resources. Motivated by this insight, we propose Easy Adaptation (EA), which designs Specific Small Models (SSMs) to complement the underfitted data distribution for LMs. Extensive experiments show that EA matches the performance of PEFT on diverse tasks without accessing LM parameters, and requires only minimal resources."}

In this work, we propose a plug-and-play calibratable disambiguation loss (CDL) that simultaneously improves classification accuracy and calibration performance. The loss has two instantiations: the first one calibrates predictions based on probabilities from the candidate label set, while the second one integrates probabilities from both candidate and non-candidate label sets. The proposed CDL can be seamlessly incorporated into existing MIPL and PLL frameworks. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes the lower bound and regularization properties of CDL, demonstrating its superiority over conventional disambiguation losses. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world datasets confirm that our CDL significantly enhances both classification and calibration performance."}

To do so, several works completely replace ID embeddings with modality embeddings, claiming that modality embeddings render ID embeddings unnecessary because they can match or even exceed ID embedding performance. On the other hand, many works jointly utilize ID and modality features, but posit that complex fusion strategies, such as multi-stage training and/or intricate alignment architectures, are necessary for this joint utilization. However, underlying both these lines of work is a lack of understanding of the complementarity of ID and modality features. In this work, we address this gap by studying the complementarity of ID- and text-based SR models. We show that these models do learn complementary signals, meaning that either should provide performance gain when used properly alongside the other. Motivated by this, we propose a new SR method that preserves ID-text complementarity through independent model training, then harnesses it through a simple ensembling strategy. Despite this method's simplicity, we show it outperforms several competitive SR baselines, implying that both ID and text features are necessary to achieve state-of-the-art SR performance but complex fusion architectures are not."}

These methods are typically formulated via overdamped or underdamped Ornstein--Uhlenbeck-type stochastic differential equations, in which sampling is driven by a combination of deterministic drift and Brownian diffusion, resulting in continuous particle trajectories in the ambient space. While such dynamics enjoy exponential convergence guarantees for strongly log-concave target distributions, it is well known that their mixing rates deteriorate exponentially in the presence of nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, such as double-well potentials. Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics.\n  A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation. Our study provides a preliminary but rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics, and aims to clarify their geometric and operator-theoretic structure as a foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments."}

Kernel-based operator learning can offer accurate, theoretically justified approximations that require less training than standard methods. However, they can become computationally prohibitive for large training sets and can be sensitive to noise. We propose a regularized random Fourier feature (RRFF) approach, coupled with a finite element reconstruction map (RRFF-FEM), for learning operators from noisy data. The method uses random features drawn from multivariate Student's $t$ distributions, together with frequency-weighted Tikhonov regularization that suppresses high-frequency noise. We establish high-probability bounds on the extreme singular values of the associated random feature matrix and show that when the number of features $N$ scales like $m \\log m$ with the number of training samples $m$, the system is well-conditioned, which yields estimation and generalization guarantees. Detailed numerical experiments on benchmark PDE problems, including advection, Burgers', Darcy flow, Helmholtz, Navier-Stokes, and structural mechanics, demonstrate that RRFF and RRFF-FEM are robust to noise and achieve improved performance with reduced training time compared to the unregularized random feature model, while maintaining competitive accuracy relative to kernel and neural operator tests."}

We present a Domain-Aware Quantum Circuit (DAQC) that leverages image priors to guide locality-preserving encoding and entanglement via non-overlapping DCT-style zigzag windows. The design employs interleaved encode-entangle-train cycles, where entanglement is applied among qubits hosting neighboring pixels, aligned to device connectivity. This staged, locality-preserving information flow expands the effective receptive field without deep global mixing, enabling efficient use of limited depth and qubits. The design concentrates representational capacity on short-range correlations, reduces long-range two-qubit operations, and encourages stable optimization, thereby mitigating depth-induced and globally entangled barren-plateau effects.
