The intersection of all valid Bell inequalities is the so-called local polytope. In multipartite systems, characterizing the local polytope quickly becomes an intractable task as the system size increases. Optimizing Bell inequalities to maximize the ratio between their quantum value and classical bound is key to understanding multipartite nonlocality. We propose a gradient-based method for this optimization. Numerical results indicate that local maxima of this ratio typically correspond to facet Bell inequalities of the local polytope. This enables an iterative search for tight and robust Bell inequalities. Applied to permutation-invariant scenarios, the method provides tight Bell inequalities with large quantum violations and facilitates experimental certification of Bell correlations without full knowledge of the local polytope."}

In this work we show that, beyond qualitative detection, a family of well-defined measures of bipartite and multipartite entanglement can be obtained with symmetry tests. We propose and benchmark several efficient methods to estimate these measures, and derive near-optimal sampling strategies for each. Despite the nonlinearity of the methods, we demonstrate that the sampling error scales no worse than $O(N_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{-1/2})$ with the total number of copies $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, which suggests experimental feasibility. By exploiting symmetries we compute our measures for large number of copies, and derive the asymptotic decay exponents for relevant states in many-body systems. Using these results we identify tradeoffs between estimation complexity and sensitivity of the presented entanglement measures, oriented to practical implementations."}

These results show a systematic and evident influence on $α$. We assess the non-Gaussianity and non-classicality measures, quantifying their nonlinearity and quantum behavior. In particular, we discover that both metrics rise monotonically with $α$. Furthermore, we examine the metrological performance for estimating $α$. By calculating the pertinent Fisher information and building workable estimators, we show that optimal strategies can saturate the Cramér-Rao bound, with straightforward position measurements on shallow wells already producing high precision. These results collectively demonstrate that the double-Morse potential is a genuine, controllable source of non-Gaussianity, whose non-classicality and metrological applications increase with $α$.

A staggered-grid arrangement, in which solution points are stored at cell centers instead of at the vertices, is presented to address the boundary conservation issues encountered in previous studies. The key ingredient in the AMR framework, i.e., the high-order nonlinear interpolation method applied in the prolongation step together with the determination of fine-grid boundary conditions, are re-derived for staggered grids following the procedures in prior work [1] and are thus used here. Meanwhile, a high-order restriction method is developed in the present study as the coarse and fine grid solutions are non-collocated in this configuration. To avoid non-conservative interpolation at discontinuous cells that could incur instabilities, a hybrid interpolation strategy is proposed in this work for the first time, where the non-conservative WENO interpolation is applied in smooth regions whereas the second-order conservative interpolation is applied at shocks. This significantly mitigates the numerical instabilities introduced by non-conservative interpolation and pointwise replacement. The two interpolation approaches are seamlessly coupled through a troubled-cell detector achieved by a scale-irrelevant Riemann solver in a robust way. The present work is developed on a publicly available block-structured adaptive mesh refinement framework AMReX [2]. The canonical tests demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of accurately resolving a wide range of complex shock-turbulence interaction problems that have been proven intricate for existing approaches"}

In this study, we present a classical data-traceable quantum oracle characterized by a circuit depth that increases linearly with the number of qubits. This configuration facilitates the learning of approximate result patterns through a shallow quantum circuit (SQC) layout.

However, traditional simulation-based optimization methods have long been plagued by significant limitations: they are typically capable of optimizing only a single problem at a time and require substantial computational time for meshing and numerical simulation. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging cutting-edge Scientific Machine Learning (Sci-ML) methodologies to overcome these inherent drawbacks of conventional approaches. The proposed method provides instantaneous solutions to a spectrum of complex, multidimensional optimization problems. A micromixer case study is employed to demonstrate this methodology. An agent, operating on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture, serves as the optimizer to explore the relationships between key problem parameters. This optimizer interacts with an environment constituted by a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which responds to the agent's actions at a significantly higher speed than traditional numerical methods. The agent's objective, conditioned on the Schmidt number is to discover the optimal geometric and physical parameters that maximize the micromixer's efficiency. After training the agent across a wide range of Schmidt numbers, we analyzed the resulting optimal designs. Across this entire spectrum, the achieved efficiency was consistently greater than the baseline, normalized value. The maximum efficiency occurred at a Schmidt number of 13.3, demonstrating an improvement of approximately 32%. Finally, a comparative analysis with a Genetic Algorithm was conducted under equivalent conditions to underscore the advantages of the proposed method."}

Starting from the QNM contribution to the Wightman function of a scalar field on a static, spherically symmetric black hole background, we derive the response function of a two-level Unruh--DeWitt detector following simple trajectories (static at fixed radius, with comments on radial free fall). The QNM sector imprints a set of Lorentzian resonances in the detector spectrum at the redshifted real parts of the QNM frequencies, with widths determined by the imaginary parts. We then treat a single dominant QNM as an effective non-Hermitian cavity mode coupled to an ensemble of driven two-level atoms, and derive a master equation of Dicke laser type. The resulting lasing threshold condition depends explicitly on the QNM damping rate, providing a direct quantum optical interpretation of the imaginary part of the QNM frequency. Specializing to the Schwarzschild geometry, we express the resonant frequencies, linewidths, and threshold in terms of photon-sphere data in the eikonal limit.

Given the expected high detection rate, performing full Bayesian analyses for each event becomes computationally challenging. To overcome this, we adopt a Fisher matrix approach, simulating parameter estimation in an idealized observation scenario, which allows us to study large populations of compact binary coalescences with feasible computational efforts. Within this framework, we investigate the constraints that ET, in its different configurations, can impose on inspiral post-Newtonian coefficients, by jointly analyzing events using a Bayesian hierarchical methodology. Our results indicate that ET could in principle achieve an accuracy of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ on the dipole radiation term and $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ on higher-order post-Newtonian coefficients, for both the triangular and the two L-shaped designs, with $10^4$ catalog events.

Quantum federated learning (QFL) overcomes these concerns by distributing model training among several quantum clients, consequently eliminating the requirement for centralized quantum storage and processing. However, in real-life quantum networks, clients frequently differ in terms of hardware capabilities, circuit designs, noise levels, and how classical data is encoded or preprocessed into quantum states. These differences create inherent heterogeneity across clients - not just in their data distributions, but also in their quantum processing behaviors. As a result, training a single global model becomes ineffective, especially when clients handle imbalanced or non-identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this, we propose a new framework called personalized quantum federated learning (PQFL) for anomaly detection. PQFL enhances local model training at quantum clients using parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers, while introducing a quantum-centric personalization strategy that adapts each client's model to its own hardware characteristics and data representation. Extensive experiments show that PQFL significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy under diverse and realistic conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PQFL reduces false errors by up to 23%, and achieves gains of 24.2% in AUROC and 20.5% in AUPR, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability in practical quantum federated settings."}

If eavesdropping or intrusion is detected mid-transmission, the system instantly alerts users and severs data flow, shielding them from unauthorized tracking and mitigating hacker threats. Over two decades, QSDC has seen extraordinary advancements, currently attaining kilobit-per-second transmission over 100 km of commercial optical fiber.

Second, we implement specialized tokenization mechanisms tailored specifically for DNA sequences, enhancing the model's ability to process genomic data, as these models are pretrained on natural language and not DNA. Third, we perform a detailed comparative analysis examining position-specific, nucleotide-type, and privacy changes between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. We assess embeddings vulnerabilities across different types and dimensions, providing deeper insights into how task adaptation shifts privacy risks throughout genomic sequences. Our findings show a clear distinction in reconstruction vulnerability between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. Notably, fine-tuning strengthens resistance to reconstruction attacks in multiple architectures -- XLNet (+19.8\\%), GPT-2 (+9.8\\%), and BERT (+7.8\\%) -- pointing to task-specific optimization as a potential privacy enhancement mechanism. These results highlight the need for advanced protective mechanisms for language models processing sensitive genomic data, while highlighting fine-tuning as a potential privacy-enhancing technique worth further exploration."}

Second, the time-varying magnetic flux generates induced electric field even outside the solenoid. In the present paper, motivated by a recent work by Gao, we re-investigate the role of the induced electric field with the utmost care.

On this background we study linear perturbations of test fields with spins $s=0,1,2$ and compute their quasinormal spectra using both a high order WKB scheme and continued fraction method, complemented by time domain evolutions. We find that increasing either the Burkert core radius $r_0$ or the central density $ρ_0$ generically shifts the real part of the frequencies upward and enhances damping, while the multipole index $l$ primarily increases the oscillation frequency with a milder impact on the decay rate. The two frequency extraction methods agree to within small, systematic offsets across the explored parameter space. Our results quantify how a cored dark matter environment imprints itself on the ringdown of a central black hole and provide benchmarks for future gravitational wave tests of halo properties."}

Many-body decoherence plays a key role in this transition, yet connecting microscopic dynamics to emergent macroscopic behavior remains challenging. Here, in a doubly disordered electron-nuclear spin network, we uncover an emergent decoherence law for nuclear polarization, $e^{-\\sqrt{R_{p}t}}e^{-R_{d}t}$, that is robust across broad parameter regimes. We trace its microscopic origins to two interdependent decoherence channels: long-range interactions mediated by the electron network and spin transport within the nuclear network exhibiting anomalous, sub-diffusive dynamics. We demonstrate the capacity to control--and even eliminate--either channel individually through a combination of Floquet engineering and (optical) environment modulation. We find that disorder, typically viewed as detrimental, here proves protective, generating isolated electron-free clusters that localize polarization and prolong coherence lifetimes. These findings establish a microscopic framework for manipulating decoherence pathways and suggests engineered disorder as a new design principle for realizing long-lived quantum memories and sensors."}

Recognizing that black hole mass variation is inherently a continuous and dynamic process, but the extended timescales required for such variations allow us, to employ a static, frame-by-frame approach. We're assuming constant mass within individual frames, while permitting inter-frame mass evolution to prob the effects of mass loss on orbital dynamics. Using this method, we investigate whether the Periapsis Shift in the extremal limit can serve as evidence for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), addressing the conjecture's role in preserving black hole integrity during evaporation. Subsequently, we analyze the Periapsis Shift under Aschenbach-like conditions, where a stable photon sphere generates non-monotonic orbital velocity profiles, to assess its dynamical impact on relativistic precession. Finally, we synthesize the combined effects of extremality and the presence of stable photon sphere, revealing profound modifications to the Periapsis Shift profile, including prograde-to-retrograde transitions and radial dependencies. Our results demonstrate that the Periapsis Shift--not merely its magnitude but its qualitative orbital behavior--allows a meaningful experimental probe for the WGC in strong-field regimes."}

By formalizing biases as violations of conditional independence through information-theoretic measures, we prove formal equivalence conditions relating spurious correlations, subpopulation shift, class imbalance, and fairness violations. Our theory predicts that a spurious correlation of strength $α$ produces equivalent worst-group accuracy degradation as a sub-population imbalance ratio $r \\approx (1+α)/(1-α)$ under feature overlap assumptions. Empirical validation in six datasets and three architectures confirms that predicted equivalences hold within the accuracy of the worst group 3\\%, enabling the principled transfer of debiasing methods across problem domains.

The electron density distribution is chosen to preserve a generalized Carter constant. We explore the shadow cast by this class of rotating wormhole in the presence of both homogeneous and non homogeneous plasma as seen by an asymptotic observer. The photon regions are visualized, and the influence of geometric parameters, plasma parameters, and the observer inclination angle with the rotation axis on the resulting shadow morphology is analyzed. We tried to implement constraints on the plasma and the geometrical parameters of the wormhole such as the spin parameter and the deviation (from Kerr) parameter in the back drop of recent observational bounds coming from the deviation from circularity of the shadow boundary ($ΔC$) and deviation of the average shadow radius from Schwarzschild ($δ$). The bound on $ΔC$ is satisfied by the theoretically allowed range of parameters thus not found very useful to put any constraint, we could impose stringent constraints on the parameters based on the observed value of $δ$.

However, achieving strong and robust macroscopic entanglement remains a long-standing challenge due to the inherently linear nature of the beam-splitter interaction. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to generate and enhance macroscopic entanglement between two remote magnon modes by injecting squeezed vacuum fields (SVFs) into coupled microwave cavities. We demonstrate that even a single SVF applied to one cavity can induce steady magnon-magnon entanglement, while applying two SVFs (the double-squeezed configuration) enables selective activation of two independent entanglement channels associated with the cavity supermodes. Remarkably, quantum interference between the two SVFs allows for phase-controlled enhancement of entanglement, resulting in significantly improved robustness against cavity dissipation and thermal noise. Under realistic parameters, the survival temperature of quantum entanglement increases from approximately $260$ mK to $450$ mK. Our results open a promising route toward controllable and thermally resilient macroscopic entanglement in cavity magnonics. Our results establish a versatile and controllable approach to generating and enhancing quantum entanglement through double-squeezed-field interference, opening new avenues to study and enhance macroscopic quantum physics in cavity-magnon systems with only beam-splitter interactions."}

From geodesic equations, we derive observable geometric quantities that can be directly compared with VLBI/VLBA astrometry, the Cassini time-delay measurement, MESSENGER data and the GP-B/LLR results.

We propose an emblematic case where advanced analysis (ML/Big Data) must necessarily be subsequent to the verification of basic methodological coherence. This study highlights a crucial cautionary principle: sophisticated analyses amplify, rather than correct, severe methodological flaws rooted in basic design choices, leading to misleading or contradictory findings. By applying simple, standard descriptive statistical methods and established national epidemiological benchmarks to a recently published cohort study on vaccine outcomes and psychiatric events, we expose multiple, statistically irreconcilable paradoxes. These paradoxes, including an implausible risk reduction for a chronic disorder in a high-risk group and contradictory incidence rate comparisons, definitively invalidate the reported hazard ratios (HRs). We demonstrate that the observed effects are mathematical artifacts stemming from an uncorrected selection bias in the cohort construction. This analysis serves as a robust reminder that even the most complex health studies must first pass the test of basic epidemiological consistency before any conclusion drawn from subsequent advanced ML or statistical modeling can be considered valid or publishable.

Any non-minimal theory introduces effective mass terms for GWs, causing \\textit{lens-induced dispersion} (LID), a frequency-dependent phase shift on the waveform. We compute GW dispersion in Einstein's general relativity (GR) for a spherical matter distribution, finding a small but non-zero phasing that is potentially accessible to next-generation detectors. We then extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories, focusing on symmetron gravity as an example of screened theory, combining cosmological deviations and consistency with local gravity tests. We find enhanced GW dispersion in a large region of the symmetron parameter space, compared to both GR and Brans-Dicke theory. We argue that dispersion, associated to an effective mass for the metric fluctuations, can in some cases prevent the propagation of GWs through some astrophysical bodies, turning them into reflectors. Our analysis shows that the Earth becomes an efficient GW shield for a hitherto unconstrained region of the symmetron parameter space, leading to a $\\sim 50\\%$ fraction of events becoming unobservable or at least displaying a dramatic modification of the detector antenna response.

Manuscript under review", "summary": "We report the realization of an all-optical, tabletop effective-negative-mass oscillator (ENMO) scheme capable of canceling quantum noise when cascaded with an opto-mechanical sensor susceptible to (quantum) radiation pressure noise. Our coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) scheme offers a broadband cancellation capability with a tunable, wavelength-flexible, and compact system. This is achieved through the implementation of an optical equivalent of an opto-mechanical interaction, facilitated by a down-conversion and a beam-splitting process. The intricate nature of the system and its multiple interacting components made characterizing the interdependent parameters with conventional methods ineffective, leading to the development of an in-situ characterization scheme. The obtained parameters meet the targets for CQNC set in previous studies. With our current realization, we project a broadband quantum noise reduction of 3.6 dB, corresponding to a 77% reduction in quantum back-action noise at the optimal frequency of maximum reduction, indicating the readiness of the ENMO for application. We discuss the prospects for new applications in quantum information and communication using the same platform."}

We explore integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into HGNNs--a direction underexplored despite MoE's success in homogeneous settings. Crucially, we question the need for type-specific experts. We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics. Our work demonstrates that regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations--a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning."}

Here we apply perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) to a many-body (MB) system of atoms modeled as charged harmonic oscillators, and reveal a persistent inverse-distance MB-QED interaction stemming from the coupling between virtual photons and molecular plasmons in the non-retarded regime. This interaction, scaling with the third power of the fine-structure constant, is reminiscent of the Lamb shift for a single atom. Although weaker than vdW forces, this MB-QED $R^{-1}$ interaction may substantially surpass gravitational attraction in future experiments probing quantum gravity at microscopic scales."}

We note that the swirling parameter $j$ and magnetic field strength $B$ make the equations of motion for particles nonseparable, and confirm the presence of chaotic behavior in the motion in this dyonic Kerr-Newman-Melvin-swirling spacetime and its sub-cases by removing the conical singularities and removing both the conical singularities and the Dirac strings. We observe that both the number of chaotic orbits and the chaotic region increase with the increase of the parameters $j$ and $B$, but decrease as the electric charge $Q$, magnetic charge $H$ or spin parameter $a$ increases. Moreover, we find that the presence of $j$ changes the ranges of $B$, $Q$, $H$ and $a$ where the chaotic motion appears for particles.

Our core finding is that when the behavior policy is factorized - a common scenario where agents act fully or partially independently during data collection - a strategy of partial action replacement (PAR) can significantly mitigate this challenge. PAR updates a single or part of agents' actions while the others remain fixed to the behavioral data, reducing distribution shift compared to full joint-action updates. Based on this insight, we develop Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL), using PAR to mitigate OOD issue and dynamically weighting different PAR strategies based on the uncertainty of value estimation. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving that under factorized behavior policies, the induced distribution shift scales linearly with the number of deviating agents rather than exponentially with the joint-action space. This yields a provably tighter value error bound for this important class of offline MARL problems. Our theoretical results also indicate that SPaCQL adaptively addresses distribution shift using uncertainty-informed weights. Our empirical results demonstrate SPaCQL enables more effective policy learning, and manifest its remarkable superiority over baseline algorithms when the offline dataset exhibits the independence structure."}

This work studies the effect of local-gauge-symmetric decoherence on the GHM from the perspective of the subsystem code. We clarify the global phase diagram of the subsystem code. In particular, the decoherence induces an unconventional critical mixed state, where the logical information is preserved but the rest of the system exhibits mixed state criticality. For a fixed point, the decohered subsystem code is understood by the ``gauging out\" prescription. By mapping the GHM to the toric code subject to decoherence, we can understand the properties of the subsystem code. We further discuss and investigate the robustness of the logical space of the subsystem code. Although this kind of subsystem code can be produced by using any bulk mixed state in the GHM, its robustness is a subtle problem due to the mixed critical gauge qubits. We consider some specific unitary for examining the robustness of the stored quantum information. For dynamical unitary perturbations described by interactions between the logical qubit and gauge qubits, the deformation of the subsystem code drastically depends on the initial mixed state of the gauge qubits."}

This allows us to restrict the required number of CNOT gates while taking the qubit connectivity architecture into account. Recent advancements using reinforcement learning have already demonstrated the power of this technique when optimizing the circuit for a sequence of non-parameterized gates.

We find that the noncommutative parameter $Θ$ and the quintessence field significantly modify both the orbital structure and the emitted waveforms. In particular, increasing $Θ$ leads to a phase shift and a change in amplitude in the waveform, while higher zoom numbers produce more complicated substructures. The characteristic strain spectra peak in the millihertz range, lying within the sensitivity band of the LISA detector. Moreover, the presence of the quintessence field introduces significant modifications to these waveforms, imprinting measurable deviations that could be tested or constrained by future space-based gravitational wave detectors.

In this paper, we study the more practical multi-query setting and propose two DP-RAG algorithms. The first, MURAG, leverages an individual privacy filter so that the accumulated privacy loss only depends on how frequently each document is retrieved rather than the total number of queries.

We experimentally demonstrate that, even when both the pump and the down-converted photons propagate through a dynamic scattering medium, the pairs maintain a sharp peak in their correlations. A comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis shows that these correlations persist regardless of when the pairs are generated, whether immediately after the pump is scattered or under other conditions. More specifically, we detail how the shape of the angular correlation depends on the pump's scattering and how it varies with the distance between the pair-generation region and the entrance of the disordered medium. These findings represent a crucial step toward understanding quantum light generation in complex media, and potentially exploiting it for quantum technologies."}

Empirically, colour categories such as black and, to a lesser extent, white function as high-degree hubs that dominate probability flow. Consequently, we assess three chain variants: the full network including all colours, a network without black, and a network without black and white, to quantify the effect of hub pruning under realistic circuit depths and measurement budgets. Across networks aggregated from multiple retailers, hub pruning consistently improves quantum and classical agreement at shallow depth; total-variation distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence typically decrease by approximately a factor of two relative to the full network, while state fidelities remain close to unity. A bias-and-contraction analysis explains these gains through reduced cross-terms and an effectively widened spectral gap.

This paper introduces a novel Character-Level Autoencoder (CAE) approach that automatically identifies and groups semantically identical columns in non-semantic relational datasets by detecting column similarities based on data patterns and structures. Unlike conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models that struggle with limitations in semantic interpretability and out-of-vocabulary tokens, our approach operates at the character level with fixed dictionary constraints, enabling scalable processing of large-scale data lakes and warehouses. The CAE architecture encodes text representations of non-semantic relational table columns and extracts high-dimensional feature embeddings for data grouping. By maintaining a fixed dictionary size, our method significantly reduces both memory requirements and training time, enabling efficient processing of large-scale industrial data environments. Experimental evaluation demonstrates substantial performance gains: our CAE approach achieved 80.95% accuracy in top 5 column matching tasks across relational datasets, substantially outperforming traditional NLP approaches such as Bag of Words (47.62%). These results demonstrate its effectiveness for identifying and clustering identical columns in relational datasets. This work bridges the gap between theoretical advances in character-level neural architectures and practical enterprise data management challenges, providing an automated solution for schema understanding and data profiling of non-semantic industrial datasets at scale."}

Traditional SPICE simulations are time-consuming, while existing machine learning methods often require topology-specific retraining or manual substructure segmentation for fine-tuning, hindering scalability and adaptability. In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations. Our experimental results demonstrate that ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models such as multilayer perceptrons, graph neural networks and transformers, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies. Additionally, when integrated into a reinforcement learning-based parameter optimization pipeline, ZeroSim achieves a remarkable speedup (13x) compared to conventional SPICE simulations, underscoring its practical value for a wide range of analog circuit design automation tasks."}

Being formally equivalent to the solution of the MB Schrödinger equation, EF sets up a strategy for the construction of efficient approximations in the theory of the correlated electronic-nuclear motion. Here we extend the EF formalism to incorporate the case of a system under the action of an electromagnetic field. An important interplay between the physical magnetic and the Berry-curvature fields is revealed and discussed within the fully non-adiabatic theory. In particular, it is a known property of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation that, for a neutral atom in a uniform magnetic field, the latter is compensated by the Berry-curvature field in the nuclear equation of motion (\\citet{Yin-92}). From an intuitive argument that the atom must not be deflected by the Lorentz force from a straight line trajectory, it has been conjectured that the same compensation should occur within the EF theory as well. We give a rigorous proof of this property."}

A natural generalization of this property is to consider whether a notion of maximal entanglement is possible among all states with the same spectrum (where the aforementioned case of pure states corresponds to the particular choice in which the spectrum is a delta distribution, i.e., rank-1 states). Despite positive evidence in the past that such a notion might exist at least in the case of two-qubit states, it was recently shown in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 050202 (2024)] that the answer to the above question is negative. This reference proved this for particular choices of the spectrum in the case of rank-2 two-qubit density matrices. While this settles the problem in general, it still leaves open whether there are other choices of the spectrum outside the case of pure states where a maximally entangled state for a fixed spectrum might exist. In this work we extend this impossibility result to all rank-2 and rank-3 two-qubit states as well as for a large class of eigenvalue distributions in the case where the rank equals four."}

Previous efforts to benchmark the performance of AI models have primarily focused on assessing model performance using group fairness metrics that rely on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), which does not provide insights into a model's ability to provide accurate estimates. In line with clinical assessments, this paper addresses this gap by incorporating calibration as a complementary benchmarking metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics. Calibration evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, offering deeper insights into subgroup biases. We assess the performance of the leading skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset and the PROVE-AI dataset, and compare it with the second and third place models, focusing on subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age.

To this end, various defenses have been proposed recently, with state-of-the-art approaches achieving robust performance even under large state perturbations. However, after closer investigation, we found that the effectiveness of the current defenses is due to a fundamental weakness of the existing $l_p$ norm-constrained attacks, which can barely alter the semantics of image input even under a relatively large perturbation budget. In this work, we propose SHIFT, a novel policy-agnostic diffusion-based state perturbation attack to go beyond this limitation. Our attack is able to generate perturbed states that are semantically different from the true states while remaining realistic and history-aligned to avoid detection. Evaluations show that our attack effectively breaks existing defenses, including the most sophisticated ones, significantly outperforming existing attacks while being more perceptually stealthy. The results highlight the vulnerability of RL agents to semantics-aware adversarial perturbations, indicating the importance of developing more robust policies."}

We show that when the quantum walk parameters, such as the coin operator and initial state, satisfy the conditions of the ergodic theorem for random walks on finite groups, the resulting sequence converges asymptotically to the uniform distribution. Although correlations between successive outcomes are unavoidable, they can be significantly reduced by a suitable choice of the evolution time.

This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging cutting-edge Scientific Machine Learning (Sci-ML) methodologies to overcome these inherent drawbacks of conventional approaches. The proposed method provides instantaneous solutions to a spectrum of complex, multidimensional optimization problems. A micromixer case study is employed to demonstrate this methodology. An agent, operating on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture, serves as the optimizer to explore the relationships between key problem parameters. This optimizer interacts with an environment constituted by a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which responds to the agent's actions at a significantly higher speed than traditional numerical methods. The agent's objective, conditioned on the Schmidt number is to discover the optimal geometric and physical parameters that maximize the micromixer's efficiency. After training the agent across a wide range of Schmidt numbers, we analyzed the resulting optimal designs. Across this entire spectrum, the achieved efficiency was consistently greater than the baseline, normalized value. The maximum efficiency occurred at a Schmidt number of 13.3, demonstrating an improvement of approximately 32%.

In the next stage, we propose a fast ranking-based algorithm that makes its decisions on the basis of the number of cars available in each zone, the projected probability density of demand, and estimated trip durations. The experiments were carried out on the basis of real-world data originating from a major car-sharing service operator in Poland. The results of this algorithm are evaluated against scenarios without optimization that constitute a baseline and compared with the results of an exact algorithm to solve the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model.

Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, for example, depend only on pairwise information -- expectations and correlations between binary variables -- yet standard quantum circuits explore exponentially large state spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometry problem: the minimal representation should match the $O(N^2)$ structure of quadratic objectives. The key insight is that the local-consistency problem -- ensuring that pairwise marginals correspond to a realizable global distribution -- coincides exactly with the Sherali-Adams level-2 polytope $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$, the tightest convex relaxation expressible at the two-body level. Previous qubit-efficient approaches enforced this consistency only implicitly.

This yields a logarithmic-width pipeline ($2\\lceil\\log_2 N\\rceil + 2$ qubits) that is classically simulable yet achieves strong empirical performance.

To address these challenges and enhance noise tolerance, we propose a novel two-stage, token-level entropy optimization method for RLVR. This approach dynamically guides the model from exploration to exploitation during training. In the initial exploration phase, token-level entropy maximization promotes diverse and stochastic output generation, serving as a strong regularizer that prevents premature convergence to noisy labels and ensures sufficient intra-group variation, which enables more reliable reward gradient estimation in GRPO. As training progresses, the method transitions into the exploitation phase, where token-level entropy minimization encourages the model to produce confident and deterministic outputs, thereby consolidating acquired knowledge and refining prediction accuracy.

Fourier transforming exponentially decaying time domain signals gives Lorentzian line shapes which can be manipulated by apodization methods. The underlying transitions of spectral lines can be visualized by a Bloch vector or equivalent phase-space representations. Here, we study and generalize a surprisingly elegant geometric transform, the hyperbolism of curves originally found by Isaac Newton, which allows to transform ellipses into Lorentzian lines, and vice versa. With this, we show that the Bloch picture and especially corresponding phase-space representations are directly geometrically related to the Lorentzian line shape. We also introduce a novel continuous parametrization of Newton's transform which results in further interesting line shapes. In particular, we find that truncated parabolic lines with finite support can be obtained by the half transform and introduce a new apodization approach to replicate this line shape in experimental spectra. We discuss concrete applications in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy."}

Using a large-scale dataset of embeddings, we train linear classifiers to identify three distinct concepts: the fundamental land-sea boundary, high-impact extreme temperature events, and atmospheric instability. Our findings provide quantitative evidence that Aurora learns physically consistent features, while also highlighting its limitations in capturing the rarest events.

This creates a compelling need for multi-objective bilevel learning (MOBL). So far, however, the field of MOBL remains in its infancy and many important problems remain under-explored. This motivates us to fill this gap and systematically investigate the theoretical and algorithmic foundation of MOBL. Specifically, we consider MOBL problems with multiple conflicting objectives guided by preferences at the upper-level subproblem, where part of the inputs depend on the optimal solution of the lower-level subproblem. Our goal is to develop efficient MOBL optimization algorithms to (1) identify a preference-guided Pareto-stationary solution with low oracle complexity; and (2) enable systematic Pareto front exploration. To this end, we propose a unifying algorithmic framework called weighted-Chebyshev multi-hyper-gradient-descent (WC-MHGD) for both deterministic and stochastic settings with finite-time Pareto-stationarity convergence rate guarantees, which not only implies low oracle complexity but also induces systematic Pareto front exploration. We further conduct extensive experiments to confirm our theoretical results."}

The contemporary solution, halting the entire quantum computation for recalibration, is unsustainable for the long runtimes of the future algorithms. We address this challenge by unifying calibration with computation, granting the quantum error correction process a dual role: its error detection events are not only used to correct the logical quantum state, but are also repurposed as a learning signal, teaching a reinforcement learning agent to continuously steer the physical control parameters and stabilize the quantum system during the computation. We experimentally demonstrate this framework on a superconducting processor, improving the logical error rate stability of the surface code 3.5-fold against injected drift and pushing the performance beyond what is achievable with state-of-the-art traditional calibration and human-expert tuning. Simulations of surface codes up to distance-15 confirm the scalability of our method, revealing an optimization speed that is independent of the system size. This work thus enables a new paradigm: a quantum computer that learns to self-improve directly from its errors and never stops computing."}

To prove their universal approximation properties, existing works typically rely on model-specific proofs. Generally, they construct a dedicated mathematical formulation for each architecture (e.g., fully connected networks, CNNs, or Transformers) and then prove their universal approximability. However, this approach suffers from two major limitations: first, every newly proposed architecture often requires a completely new proof from scratch; second, these proofs are largely isolated from one another, lacking a common analytical foundation. This not only incurs significant redundancy but also hinders unified theoretical understanding across different network families. To address these issues, this paper proposes a general and modular framework for proving universal approximation. We define a basic building block (comprising one or multiple layers) that possesses the universal approximation property as a Universal Approximation Module (UAM). Under this condition, we show that any deep network composed of such modules inherently retains the universal approximation property. Moreover, the overall approximation process can be interpreted as a progressive refinement across modules. This perspective not only unifies the analysis of diverse architectures but also enables a step-by-step understanding of how expressive power evolves through the network."}

This is particularly true when we focus on highly-constrained early fault-tolerant devices. Many attempts to optimize algorithms for early fault-tolerance focus on simple metrics, such as the circuit depth or T-count. These metrics fail to capture critical overheads, such as the spacetime cost of Clifford operations and routing, or miss they key optimizations. We propose the FLuid Allocation of Surface code Qubits (FLASQ) cost model, tailored for architectures that use a two-dimensional lattice of qubits to implement the two-dimensional surface code. FLASQ abstracts away the complexity of routing by assuming that ancilla space and time can be fluidly rearranged, allowing for the tractable estimation of spacetime volume while still capturing important details neglected by simpler approaches. At the same time, it enforces constraints imposed by the circuit's measurement depth and the processor's reaction time. We apply FLASQ to analyze the cost of a standard two-dimensional lattice model simulation, finding that modern advances (such as magic state cultivation and the combination of quantum error correction and mitigation) reduce both the time and space required for this task by an order of magnitude compared with previous estimates. We also analyze the Hamming weight phasing approach to synthesizing parallel rotations, revealing that despite its low T-count, the overhead from imposing a 2D layout and from its use of additional ancilla qubits will make it challenging to benefit from in early fault-tolerance. We hope that the FLASQ cost model will help to better align early fault-tolerant algorithmic design with actual hardware realization costs without demanding excessive knowledge of quantum error correction from quantum algorithmists."}

We work in the setting of deep thermalization from many-body physics: starting from a bipartite state on a global system $(A,B)$ drawn from a $k$-design, we measure system $B$ in the computational basis, keep the outcome and examine the state that remains in system $A$, approximating the overall ensemble (the 'projected ensemble') by a $k'$-design. We ask: how does the design quality change due to this procedure, or how does $k'$ compare to $k$? We give the first rigorous example of unitary dynamics generating a state such that, projection at very early (constant) times can boost design randomness. These dynamics are those of quantum chaos, modeled by the evolution of a Hamiltonian drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We show that, even though a state generated by such dynamics at constant time only forms a $k=\\mathcal{O}(1)$ design, the projected ensemble is Haar-random (or a $k'=\\infty$ design) in the thermodynamic limit (i.e. when $N_B=\\infty$). This phenomenon persists even with weaker and more physically realistic assumptions; our results can be appropriately applied to non-GUE Hamiltonians that nevertheless show likely chaotic signatures in their eigenbases. Moreover, we show that with no assumption on how the global state was generated, a $k$-design experiences a degradation in design quality to $k' = \\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor$. This improves upon best prior results on the deep thermalization of designs.

We introduce a multi-scale hierarchical signal processing module that reorganizes backbone features into temporal multi-scale representations, together with an introspective uncertainty estimation module that assigns per-cycle reliability scores and guides iterative refinement. We instantiate this framework on three standard EEG backbones (EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet) and evaluate four-class MI decoding using the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset under a subject-independent setting.

Under continuous-wave excitation, we find critical coupling of both the pump and biphoton to maximize the rate of single photons extracted from the microring, whereas critical coupling of the pump but overcoupling of the biphoton maximize the two-photon rate. Under pulsed pumping, overcoupling of both pump and biphoton (to different degrees) maximizes photon extraction probabilities, albeit under a tradeoff with spectral factorability that we quantify via parameter scans over a range of coupler pairings.

We generalize the spectral evolution function from the linear kernel form $g(λt)=λt$ to an asymptotically polynomial function $g(λ,t;β)$, characterized by an effective spectral--temporal elasticity $ρ(β)$. This framework recovers existing lazy and feature-learning theories as special cases and yields an invariant relation between learning and compression"}

Although such phenomena have been demonstrated in non-equilibrium settings, their use for fluctuation engineering has been put forth in Raman-cavity hybrids only recently. In this work, we generalize fluctuation engineering to a multi-mode scenario in which multiple Raman-active modes interact nonlinearly with multiple cavity modes. We demonstrate the emergence of resonant and non-resonant collective fluctuations that can be non-reciprocally controlled by engineering the band dispersion of photons and phonons. As an example we show how Raman fluctuations can be selectively attenuated by tuning the photonic bandgap or even nonresonantly amplified, in marked contrast to the single-mode scenario. We also identify a regime in which the amplification of cavity fluctuations in a specific mode is boosted, surpassing a $\\sqrt{N}$ scaling with increasing number of $N$ Raman and cavity modes. Our study reveals the key role of multi-mode interactions on fluctuations in nonlinear cavity-matter hybrids. Noise engineering through different photon and phonon dispersions, as demonstrated here, could be leveraged for the design of novel quantum sensing platforms and advanced spectroscopy in the THz regime."}

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone."}

Quantum federated learning (QFL) overcomes these concerns by distributing model training among several quantum clients, consequently eliminating the requirement for centralized quantum storage and processing. However, in real-life quantum networks, clients frequently differ in terms of hardware capabilities, circuit designs, noise levels, and how classical data is encoded or preprocessed into quantum states. These differences create inherent heterogeneity across clients - not just in their data distributions, but also in their quantum processing behaviors. As a result, training a single global model becomes ineffective, especially when clients handle imbalanced or non-identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this, we propose a new framework called personalized quantum federated learning (PQFL) for anomaly detection. PQFL enhances local model training at quantum clients using parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers, while introducing a quantum-centric personalization strategy that adapts each client's model to its own hardware characteristics and data representation. Extensive experiments show that PQFL significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy under diverse and realistic conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PQFL reduces false errors by up to 23%, and achieves gains of 24.2% in AUROC and 20.5% in AUPR, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability in practical quantum federated settings."}

RL typically employs reward functions to define task objectives and guide agent learning. However, since the reward function serves the dual purpose of defining the optimal goal and guiding learning, it is challenging to design the reward function manually, which often results in a suboptimal task representation. To tackle the reward design challenge in RL, inspired by the satisficing theory, we propose a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework. In the TdRL framework, multiple test functions are used to represent the task objective rather than a single reward function. Test functions can be categorized as pass-fail tests and indicative tests, each dedicated to defining the optimal objective and guiding the learning process, respectively, thereby making defining tasks easier. Building upon such a task definition, we first prove that if a trajectory return function assigns higher returns to trajectories closer to the optimal trajectory set, maximum entropy policy optimization based on this return function will yield a policy that is closer to the optimal policy set. Then, we introduce a lexicographic heuristic approach to compare the relative distance relationship between trajectories and the optimal trajectory set for learning the trajectory return function. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm implementation of TdRL. Experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark demonstrate that TdRL matches or outperforms handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with greater design simplicity and inherent support for multi-objective optimization. We argue that TdRL offers a novel perspective for representing task objectives, which could be helpful in addressing the reward design challenges in RL applications."}

We show that in-context learning can transform structured feedback into gradient-like directional information, enabling targeted edits. Unlike prior approaches that collapse judgments into single bits, our evaluators pair each comparison with textual feedback, which functions as high-bandwidth supervision. The iteration loop is done purely at inference time, without modifying any model weights, and is task-agnostic. We evaluate Feedback Descent on three diverse domains and find that it outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization (GEPA), reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, REINVENT), and even specialized graph-based molecular optimizers.

However, applying RL to open-domain tasks faces two key challenges: (1) the inherent subjectivity of these tasks prevents the verifiable rewards as required by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR); (2) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on external reward mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Self-Examining Reinforcement Learning (SERL), a novel self-improving framework where the LLM serves as both Actor and Judge. SERL introduces two synergistic reward mechanisms without any external signals. On the one hand, to improve the Actor's capability, we derive rewards from Copeland-style pairwise comparison judgments across a group of generated responses. On the other hand, a self-consistency reward that encourages coherent judgments is proposed to improve the Judge's reliability. This process refines the Judge's capability, which in turn provides a more robust reward for Actor. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing self-improvement training methods. SERL improves the LC win rate of Qwen3-8B on AlpacaEval 2 from 52.37% to 59.90%. To the best of our knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-improving approaches. Furthermore, it achieves a performance comparable to significantly larger models like Qwen3-32B, demonstrating superior effectiveness and robustness on open-domain tasks."}

We address this gap with a decision-focused continual learning framework that adapts online to a stream of scheduling tasks. Specifically, we introduce Fisher information based regularization to enhance cross-task generalization by preserving parameters critical to prior tasks. A differentiable convex surrogate is also developed to stabilize gradient backpropagation. The proposed approach enables learning a decision-aligned forecasting model for new scheduling tasks while retaining generalization on earlier tasks.

We address this challenge through Balance Equation-based Distributionally Robust Offline Imitation Learning, a framework that learns robust policies solely from expert demonstrations collected under nominal dynamics, without requiring further environment interaction. We formulate the problem as a distributionally robust optimization over an uncertainty set of transition models, seeking a policy that minimizes the imitation loss under the worst-case transition distribution. Importantly, we show that this robust objective can be reformulated entirely in terms of the nominal data distribution, enabling tractable offline learning. Empirical evaluations on continuous-control benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior robustness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art offline IL baselines, particularly under perturbed or shifted environments."}

However, existing methods typically assume that unlearning requests arrive all at once, whereas in practice they often arrive sequentially. We present the first systematic study of continual unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models and show that popular unlearning methods suffer from rapid utility collapse: after only a few requests, models forget retained knowledge and generate degraded images. We trace this failure to cumulative parameter drift from the pre-training weights and argue that regularization is crucial to addressing it. To this end, we study a suite of add-on regularizers that (1) mitigate drift and (2) remain compatible with existing unlearning methods. Beyond generic regularizers, we show that semantic awareness is essential for preserving concepts close to the unlearning target, and propose a gradient-projection method that constrains parameter drift orthogonal to their subspace. This substantially improves continual unlearning performance and is complementary to other regularizers for further gains.

Fuzzy rule-based models excel in interpretability and have seen widespread application across diverse fields. However, they face challenges such as complex design specifications and scalability issues with large datasets. The fusion of different techniques and strategies, particularly Gradient Boosting, with Fuzzy Rule-Based Models offers a robust solution to these challenges. This paper proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework that merges the strengths of both paradigms to enhance model performance and interpretability. At each iteration, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Model is constructed and controlled by a dynamic factor to optimize its contribution to the overall ensemble. This control factor serves multiple purposes: it prevents model dominance, encourages diversity, acts as a regularization parameter, and provides a mechanism for dynamic tuning based on model performance, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the framework incorporates a sample-based correction mechanism that allows for adaptive adjustments based on feedback from a validation set. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the presented gradient boosting framework for fuzzy rule-based models, demonstrating performance enhancement, especially in terms of mitigating overfitting and complexity typically associated with many rules. By leveraging an optimal factor to govern the contribution of each model, the framework improves performance, maintains interpretability, and simplifies the maintenance and update of the models."}

We validate the HK primitives across CDNA3 and CDNA4 AMD platforms. In evaluations, HK kernels compete with AMD's hand-optimized assembly kernels for GEMMs and attention, and consistently outperform compiler baselines.

Recent work suggests that the underlying causal graphs of such dynamics models are sparsely connected, with each of the future state variables depending only on a small subset of the current state variables, and that learning may therefore benefit from sparsity priors. Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias.\n  In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks.\n  We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely.\n  Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions. These findings challenge common sparsity prior assumptions in dynamics learning, emphasizing the need for grounded inductive biases that reflect the state-dependent sparsity structure of real-world dynamics."}

Stuart-Landau oscillators are canonical models of limit-cycle behavior near Hopf bifurcations, which are fundamental to synchronization theory and are widely used in e.g. neuroscience for mesoscopic brain modeling. Unlike harmonic oscillators and phase-only Kuramoto models, Stuart-Landau oscillators retain both amplitude and phase dynamics, enabling rich phenomena such as amplitude regulation and multistable synchronization. The proposed SLGNN generalizes existing phase-centric Kuramoto-based OGNNs by allowing node feature amplitudes to evolve dynamically according to Stuart-Landau dynamics, with explicit tunable hyperparameters (such as the Hopf-parameter and the coupling strength) providing additional control over the interplay between feature amplitudes and network structure. We conduct extensive experiments across node classification, graph classification, and graph regression tasks, demonstrating that SLGNN outperforms existing OGNNs and establishes a novel, expressive, and theoretically grounded framework for deep oscillatory architectures on graphs."}

In this work, we propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol for assessing the long-term sustainability of ML models, applicable to both batch and streaming learning scenarios. Through experiments on diverse classification tasks using a range of model types, we demonstrate that traditional static train-test evaluations do not reliably capture sustainability under evolving data and repeated model updates. Our results show that long-term sustainability varies significantly across models, and in many cases, higher environmental cost yields little performance benefit."}

In many real-world settings, online interactions can be risky, and accurately specifying the reward and the safety cost information at each timestep can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories reflecting undesirable or risky behavior, implicitly conveying the behavior the agent should avoid. We refer to these trajectories as non-preferred trajectories. Unlike standard IL, which aims to mimic demonstrations, our agent must also learn to avoid risky behavior using non-preferred trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, SafeMIL, to learn a parameterized cost that predicts if the state-action pair is risky via \\textit{Multiple Instance Learning}. The learned cost is then used to avoid non-preferred behaviors, resulting in a policy that prioritizes safety. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn a safer policy that satisfies cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thereby outperforming several baselines."}

Several Reinforcement Learning (RL) based solutions offer improved client selection for FL; however, they do not consider infrastructure challenges, such as resource limitations and device churn. Furthermore, the training of RL methods is often not designed for practical application, as these approaches frequently do not consider generalizability and are not optimized for energy efficiency. To fill this gap, we propose BIPPO (Budget-aware Independent Proximal Policy Optimization), which is an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution that improves performance. We evaluate BIPPO on two image classification tasks run in a highly budget-constrained setting, with FL clients training on non-IID data, a challenging context for vanilla FL. The improved sampler of BIPPO enables it to increase the mean accuracy compared to non-RL mechanisms, traditional PPO, and IPPO. In addition, BIPPO only consumes a negligible proportion of the budget, which stays consistent even if the number of clients increases. Overall, BIPPO delivers a performant, stable, scalable, and sustainable solution for client selection in IoT-FL."}

To address these challenges, we propose Information-preserving Graph Neural Simulators (IGNS), a graph-based neural simulator built on the principles of Hamiltonian dynamics. This structure guarantees preservation of information across the graph, while extending to port-Hamiltonian systems allows the model to capture a broader class of dynamics, including non-conservative effects.

The evaluation of continual learning methods relies on splitting a known homogeneous dataset and learning the associated tasks one after the other.

We exemplify this point with the case of methods relying on pretrained feature extractors, which are still used in CL. After showing that pretrained feature extractors imply a loss of generality with respect to the data that can be learned by the model, we then discuss other kinds of a priori information introduced in other CL methods. We then present the Online Patch Redundancy Eliminator (OPRE), an online dataset compression algorithm, which, along with the training of a classifier at test time, yields performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 superior to a number of other state-of-the-art online continual learning methods.

For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies.

To address this, we propose a novel method that learns feature groups by clustering weights of feature-wise embedding layers. This approach seamlessly integrates into standard supervised training and discovers the groups that directly improve downstream performance on clinically relevant tasks.

To circumvent this, explanation-guided input manipulation has emerged as an indirect evaluation strategy, measuring explanation effectiveness through the impact of input modifications on model outcomes during inference. Despite the widespread use, a major concern with inference-based schemes is the distribution shift caused by such manipulations, which undermines the reliability of their assessments. The retraining-based scheme ROAR overcomes this issue by adapting the model to the altered data distribution. However, its evaluation results often contradict the theoretical foundations of widely accepted explainers. This work investigates this misalignment between empirical observations and theoretical expectations. In particular, we identify the sign issue as a key factor responsible for residual information that ultimately distorts retraining-based evaluation. Based on the analysis, we show that a straightforward reframing of the evaluation process can effectively resolve the identified issue. Building on the existing framework, we further propose novel variants that jointly structure a comprehensive perspective on explanation evaluation. These variants largely improve evaluation efficiency over the standard retraining protocol, thereby enhancing practical applicability for explainer selection and benchmarking. Following our proposed schemes, empirical results across various data scales provide deeper insights into the performance of carefully selected explainers, revealing open challenges and future directions in explainability research."}

To address these issues, we propose an efficient GCL framework that transforms the input graph into a compact network of interconnected node sets while preserving structural information across communities. We firstly introduce a kernelized graph community contrastive loss with linear complexity, enabling effective information transfer among node sets to capture hierarchical structural information of the graph.

A critical bottleneck for this strategy is the output diversity limit, which occurs when the model generates similar outputs despite stochastic sampling, and hence recites the same error. To address this lack of variance in reasoning paths, we propose a novel unsupervised activation steering strategy that simultaneously optimizes the steering vectors for multiple reasoning trajectories at test time. At any synchronization anchor along the batch generation process, we find the steering vectors that maximize the total volume spanned by all possible intervened activation subsets. We demonstrate that these steering vectors can be determined by solving a Riemannian optimization problem over the product of spheres with a log-determinant objective function. We then use a Riemannian block-coordinate descent algorithm with a well-tuned learning rate to obtain a stationary point of the problem, and we apply these steering vectors until the generation process reaches the subsequent synchronization anchor. Empirical evaluations on popular mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our test-time Riemannian activation steering strategy outperforms vanilla sampling techniques in terms of generative diversity and solution accuracy."}

Here, we present MolRuleLoss, a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework that improves the accuracy and generalizability of multiple molecular property regression models (MPRMs) such as GEM and UniMol for diverse molecular property prediction tasks. MolRuleLoss incorporates partial derivative constraints for substructure substitution rules (SSRs) into an MPRM's loss function. When using GEM models for predicting lipophilicity, water solubility, and solvation-free energy (using lipophilicity, ESOL, and freeSolv datasets from MoleculeNet), the root mean squared error (RMSE) values with and without MolRuleLoss were 0.587 vs. 0.660, 0.777 vs. 0.798, and 1.252 vs. 1.877, respectively, representing 2.6-33.3% performance improvements. We show that both the number and the quality of SSRs contribute to the magnitude of prediction accuracy gains obtained upon adding MolRuleLoss to an MPRM. MolRuleLoss improved the generalizability of MPRMs for \"activity cliff\" molecules in a lipophilicity prediction task and improved the generalizability of MPRMs for OOD molecules in a melting point prediction task. In a molecular weight prediction task for OOD molecules, MolRuleLoss reduced the RMSE value of a GEM model from 29.507 to 0.007. We also provide a formal demonstration that the upper bound of the variation for property change of SSRs is positively correlated with an MPRM's error. Together, we show that using the MolRuleLoss framework as a bolt-on boosts the prediction accuracy and generalizability of multiple MPRMs, supporting diverse applications in areas like cheminformatics and AI-aided drug discovery."}

In this work, we first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a simple adversarial poisoning strategy is sufficient to induce maximally unfair behavior in naive Bayes classifiers. Our key idea is to strategically inject a small fraction of carefully crafted adversarial data points into the training set, biasing the model's decision boundary to disproportionately affect a protected group while preserving generalizable performance. To illustrate the practical effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments across several benchmark datasets and models. We find that our attack significantly outperforms existing methods in degrading fairness metrics across multiple models and datasets, often achieving substantially higher levels of unfairness with a comparable or only slightly worse impact on accuracy.

Therefore, Lexicographic Multi-Objective RL (LMORL) methods have been developed to address these challenges. However, existing LMORL methods either rely on heuristic threshold tuning with prior knowledge or are restricted to discrete domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lexicographically Projected Policy Gradient RL (LPPG-RL), a novel LMORL framework which leverages sequential gradient projections to identify feasible policy update directions, thereby enabling LPPG-RL broadly compatible with all policy gradient algorithms in continuous spaces. LPPG-RL reformulates the projection step as an optimization problem, and utilizes Dykstra's projection rather than generic solvers to deliver great speedups, especially for small- to medium-scale instances. In addition, LPPG-RL introduces Subproblem Exploration (SE) to prevent gradient vanishing, accelerate convergence and enhance stability. We provide theoretical guarantees for convergence and establish a lower bound on policy improvement. Finally, through extensive experiments in a 2D navigation environment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LPPG-RL, showing that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art continuous LMORL methods."}

In this work, we propose HN-MVTS, a novel architecture that integrates a hypernetwork-based generative prior with an arbitrary neural network forecasting model. The input of this hypernetwork is a learnable embedding matrix of time series components. To restrict the number of new parameters, the hypernetwork learns to generate the weights of the last layer of the target forecasting networks, serving as a data-adaptive regularizer that improves generalization and long-range predictive accuracy. The hypernetwork is used only during the training, so it does not increase the inference time compared to the base forecasting model. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that application of HN-MVTS to the state-of-the-art models (DLinear, PatchTST, TSMixer, etc.) typically improves their performance. Our findings suggest that hypernetwork-driven parameterization offers a promising direction for enhancing existing forecasting techniques in complex scenarios."}

We propose Adaptive Regularized Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (ARAC), which integrates an attention-based graph neural network (GNN) for modeling agent dependencies with an adaptive divergence regularization mechanism. The GNN enables expressive representation of spatial relations and state features in graph environments. Divergence regularization can serve as policy guidance to alleviate the sparse reward problem, but it may lead to suboptimal convergence when the reference policy itself is imperfect. The adaptive divergence regularization mechanism enables the framework to exploit reference policies for efficient exploration in the early stages, while gradually reducing reliance on them as training progresses to avoid inheriting their limitations. Experiments in pursuit and confrontation scenarios demonstrate that ARAC achieves faster convergence, higher final success rates, and stronger scalability across varying numbers of agents compared with MARL baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in complex graph-structured environments."}

Conventional methods rely on large batches for approximation, demanding substantial computational resources. To mitigate this issue, prior works introduced per-sample normalizer estimators, which are updated at each epoch in a blockwise coordinate manner to keep track of updated encoders. However, this scheme incurs optimization error that scales with the ratio of dataset size to batch size, limiting effectiveness for large datasets or small batches. To overcome this limitation, we propose NeuCLIP, a novel and elegant optimization framework based on two key ideas: (i) $\\textbf{reformulating}$ the contrastive loss for each sample $\\textbf{via convex analysis}$ into a minimization problem with an auxiliary variable representing its log-normalizer; and (ii) $\\textbf{transforming}$ the resulting minimization over $n$ auxiliary variables (where $n$ is the dataset size) via $\\textbf{variational analysis}$ into the minimization over a compact neural network that predicts the log-normalizers. We design an alternating optimization algorithm that jointly trains the CLIP model and the auxiliary network.

Traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive and sensitive to discretisation, while canonical deep learning methods are data-hungry and struggle with chaotic dynamics and long-term predictions. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) mitigate some of these issues by incorporating physical constraints in the learning process, yet they remain limited by mesh resolution and long-term predictive stability. In this work, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) approach to solve PDE problems in cardiac EP. Unlike PINNs, PINO models learn mappings between function spaces, allowing them to generalise to multiple mesh resolutions and initial conditions. Our results show that PINO models can accurately reproduce cardiac EP dynamics over extended time horizons and across multiple propagation scenarios, including zero-shot evaluations on scenarios unseen during training. Additionally, our PINO models maintain high predictive quality in long roll-outs (where predictions are recursively fed back as inputs), and can scale their predictive resolution by up to 10x the training resolution. These advantages come with a significant reduction in simulation time compared to numerical PDE solvers, highlighting the potential of PINO-based approaches for efficient and scalable cardiac EP simulations."}

Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality."}

This culminates in rigidity results under the demand for universal improvement, establishing coherence as a fundamental and, in a formal sense, necessary principle for provable self-improvement."}

Existing approaches struggle to transfer knowledge effectively. We propose 'One Model for All', a universal pre-training framework for EEG analysis across disparate datasets. Our paradigm decouples learning into two stages: (1) Univariate pre-training via self-supervised contrastive learning on individual channels, enabled by a Unified Channel Schema (UCS) that leverages the channel union (e.g., SEED-62ch, DEAP-32ch); (2) Multivariate fine-tuning with a novel 'ART' (Adaptive Resampling Transformer) and 'GAT' (Graph Attention Network) architecture to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Experiments show universal pre-training is an essential stabilizer, preventing collapse on SEED (vs. scratch) and yielding substantial gains on DEAP (+7.65%) and DREAMER (+3.55%). Our framework achieves new SOTA performance on all within-subject benchmarks: SEED (99.27%), DEAP (93.69%), and DREAMER (93.93%). We also show SOTA cross-dataset transfer, achieving 94.08% (intersection) and 93.05% (UCS) on the unseen DREAMER dataset, with the former surpassing the within-domain pre-training benchmark. Ablation studies validate our architecture: the GAT module is critical, yielding a +22.19% gain over GCN on the high-noise DEAP dataset, and its removal causes a catastrophic -16.44% performance drop.

We revisit this paradox and show that sparsity is a surface artifact of a model-conditioned optimization bias: for a fixed pretrained model, updates consistently localize to preferred parameter regions, highly consistent across runs and largely invariant to datasets and RL recipes. We mechanistically explain these dynamics with a Three-Gate Theory: Gate I (KL Anchor) imposes a KL-constrained update; Gate II (Model Geometry) steers the step off principal directions into low-curvature, spectrum-preserving subspaces; and Gate III (Precision) hides micro-updates in non-preferred regions, making the off-principal bias appear as sparsity. We then validate this theory and, for the first time, provide a parameter-level characterization of RLVR's learning dynamics: RLVR learns off principal directions in weight space, achieving gains via minimal spectral drift, reduced principal-subspace rotation, and off-principal update alignment. In contrast, SFT targets principal weights, distorts the spectrum, and even lags RLVR.\n  Together, these results provide the first parameter-space account of RLVR's training dynamics, revealing clear regularities in how parameters evolve. Crucially, we show that RL operates in a distinct optimization regime from SFT, so directly adapting SFT-era parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods can be flawed, as evidenced by our case studies on advanced sparse fine-tuning and LoRA variants.

Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, for example, depend only on pairwise information -- expectations and correlations between binary variables -- yet standard quantum circuits explore exponentially large state spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometry problem: the minimal representation should match the $O(N^2)$ structure of quadratic objectives. The key insight is that the local-consistency problem -- ensuring that pairwise marginals correspond to a realizable global distribution -- coincides exactly with the Sherali-Adams level-2 polytope $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$, the tightest convex relaxation expressible at the two-body level. Previous qubit-efficient approaches enforced this consistency only implicitly.
