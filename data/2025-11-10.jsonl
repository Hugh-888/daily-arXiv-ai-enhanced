However, identifying these optimal parameters\nthrough topology optimization (TO) across a large parametric space requires\nextensive computational resources. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel deep learning framework for metamaterial topology optimization using an\nenhanced deep super-resolution (EDSR) approach. Generating low-resolution\ntopologies significantly reduces computational cost compared to high-resolution\ndesigns. Therefore, an EDSR network is trained to learn the mapping between\nlow- and high-resolution metamaterial topologies. The training dataset is\ngenerated using solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP)-based TO. We\ndemonstrate the proposed approach for the design of mechanical metamaterials\ntargeting objectives such as maximization of bulk modulus, shear modulus, and\nelastic modulus, and minimization of Poisson's ratio. Quantitative assessments\n-including (i) pixel value error, (ii) objective function error, (iii)\nintersection over union, and (iv) volume fraction error -validate the accuracy\nof the EDSR-based TO. Our framework predicts high-resolution topologies of size\n$192 \\times 192$ from optimized low-resolution topologies of size $48 \\times\n48$. Once trained, the proposed network predicts these high-resolution\ntopologies with only $5-7\\%$ of the computational cost required by conventional\nSIMP-based TO at the same resolution. Moreover, by adding upscale blocks, the\nframework can generate smoother, higher-resolution topologies suitable for 3D\nprinting. This approach offers a scalable and efficient solution with strong\npotential for multidisciplinary metamaterial design applications."}

We investigate how the overall entanglement, as well as its\nlocalization in the system, influence the performance of the reservoir.\nFocusing on bilinear memory tasks that require computing the product of the two\ninputs, we evaluate the short-term memory capacity and correlate it with\nlogarithmic negativity as a measure of bipartite entanglement. We find that\nshort-term memory capacity reaches its maximum at relatively small coupling\nstrengths. In contrast, average entanglement peaks at larger couplings.\nAnalyzing entanglement across all bipartitions, we find that the entanglement\nbetween the two input qubits is consistently the strongest and most relevant\nfor task performance. In the small coupling strength regime where the\nshort-term memory capacity is maximized, the reservoir exhibits an extended\nmemory tail: performance remains high for a long time. Finally, a pronounced\ndip in performance at zero time delay, observed across frequencies, indicates\nthat information requires a finite propagation time through the reservoir\nbefore it can be effectively recalled. In summary, our results show that\nmoderate entanglement, particularly between the two input qubits, plays a key\nrole in enhancing short-term memory performance."}

We focus\non data-scarce regimes where the number of training samples falls below the\ncritical threshold, making grokking unobservable, and on practical scenarios\ninvolving distribution shift. We first show that Knowledge Distillation (KD)\nfrom a model that has already grokked on a distribution (p1) can induce and\naccelerate grokking on a different distribution (p2), even when the available\ndata lies below the critical threshold. This highlights the value of KD for\ndeployed models that must adapt to new distributions under limited data. We\nthen study training on the joint distribution (p1, p2) and demonstrate that\nwhile standard supervised training fails when either distribution has\ninsufficient data, distilling from models grokked on the individual\ndistributions enables generalization. Finally, we examine a continual\npretraining setup, where a grokked model transitions from p1 to p2, and find\nthat KD both accelerates generalization and mitigates catastrophic forgetting,\nachieving strong performance even with only 10% of the data.

Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary\nmasks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses\nunderutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up\nto 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks.

Since\nthe communication channel is subject to noise, Alice performs a weak\nmeasurement on the shared qubit before transmission to reduce the impact of\ndecoherence.

In the noiseless case, we prove that the\ntrajectory of the regression parameters in EM iterations traces a cycloid by\nestablishing a recurrence relation for the sub-optimality angle, while in high\nSNR regimes we quantify its discrepancy from the cycloid trajectory. The\ntrajectory-based analysis reveals the order of convergence: linear when the EM\nestimate is nearly orthogonal to the ground truth, and quadratic when the angle\nbetween the estimate and ground truth is small at the population level. Our\nanalysis establishes non-asymptotic guarantees by sharpening bounds on\nstatistical errors between finite-sample and population EM updates, relating\nEM's statistical accuracy to the sub-optimality angle, and proving convergence\nwith arbitrary initialization at the finite-sample level. This work provides a\nnovel trajectory-based framework for analyzing EM in Mixed Linear Regression."}

We focus on the subclass of\nstabilizer circuits composed of Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS)-preserving\nstabilizer operations, which naturally appear in fault-tolerant computations\nover CSS stabilizer codes. Using elementary circuit-transformation techniques,\nwe show that such circuits can be exactly rewritten as classical probabilistic\ncircuits that reproduce measurement statistics. This rewriting introduces no\ncomputational overhead, in contrast to the general case of stabilizer circuits.\nTo clarify the origin of this simplification, we introduce the standard\nquadratic-form representation of general stabilizer operations (Clifford\nchannels). It provides an efficient way to describe compositions of stabilizer\noperations and thus to simulate stabilizer circuits. CSS-preserving operations\ncorrespond to purely linear forms, which under a Walsh-Hadamard-Fourier\ntransform yield a noncontextual hidden variable model, providing an alternative\nproof of the introduced rewriting. Finally, we develop a theory of reference\nframes for multiqubit systems, where frames are encoded by quadratic forms.\nThis allows us to express stabilizer operations as probabilistic maps for\nproper reference frames. Non-CSS-preserving stabilizer circuits require\ndynamical modifications of reference frames, embodying a contextuality resource\nthat leads to the computational overhead.

Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that\nartificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent\nstate update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at\nspecific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design\nprocess, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress &\nAttend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two\nsimple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of\ntokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression\nresults in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and\nmemory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for\nefficiency.
