We describe the mathematical theory behind this\nmethod, including ensuring certain bounds on the magnetic energy, and the\ndifferential geometry behind transforming to and from a logical domain and\nphysical domain. Our code is designed to address a number of traditional\nchallenges to 3D MHD equilibrium solvers, e.g. exactly enforcing physical\nconstraints such as divergence-free magnetic field, exhibiting high levels of\nnumerical convergence, dealing with complex geometries, and modeling stochastic\nfield lines or chaotic behavior. By using differentiable Python, our numerical\nmethod comes with the additional benefits of computational efficiency on modern\ncomputing architectures, high code accessibility, and differentiability at each\nstep. The proposed magnetic relaxation solver is robustly benchmarked and\ntested with standard examples, including solving 2D toroidal equilibria at\nhigh-beta, and a rotating ellipse stellarator.

The analysis of quantum Fisher information\nreveals that the PD regime significantly enhances precision for estimating the\nIsing interaction strength while simultaneously suppressing sensitivity to the\ntransverse magnetic field. Conversely, non-PD regimes are optimal for sensing\nthe transverse field. This filtering effect is robust for larger system sizes\nand is quantifiable using experimentally accessible observables, such as\nmagnetization and two-qubit correlations, via the classical Fisher information.\nOur work shows that distinct dynamical regimes in finite-size Floquet systems\ncan be harnessed for targeted quantum sensing."}

The central result is obtained by analyzing\nthe amplitude of spinfoam stack in the limit where an upper cut-off on the area\nof internal faces is taken to infinity.

MedM2T outperformed\nstate-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series\nmodels, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction;\nan AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean\nAbsolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the\nrobustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising\ntool in clinical prediction.

We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream.

Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via\nresampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model\nreasoning, and principled CoT interventions."}

Experimental results show that our method can\nsuccessfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\\% consistent results\nacross random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming\nsolver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging\nORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs\non optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization\nmodeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4\nachieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even\nleading reasoning models."}

However, an emerging\nparadigm instead views model training as extracting enough information from\ndata so that the model can be used to minimize many losses on many downstream\ntasks. We formalize a mathematical framework for this paradigm, which we call\npanprediction, and study its statistical complexity. Formally, panprediction\ngeneralizes omniprediction and sits upstream from multi-group learning, which\nrespectively focus on predictions that generalize to many downstream losses or\nmany downstream tasks, but not both. Concretely, we design algorithms that\nlearn deterministic and randomized panpredictors with\n$\\tilde{O}(1/\\varepsilon^3)$ and $\\tilde{O}(1/\\varepsilon^2)$ samples,\nrespectively. Our results demonstrate that under mild assumptions,\nsimultaneously minimizing infinitely many losses on infinitely many tasks can\nbe as statistically easy as minimizing one loss on one task. Along the way, we\nimprove the best known sample complexity guarantee of deterministic\nomniprediction by a factor of $1/\\varepsilon$, and match all other known sample\ncomplexity guarantees of omniprediction and multi-group learning. Our key\ntechnical ingredient is a nearly lossless reduction from panprediction to a\nstatistically efficient notion of calibration, called step calibration."}

Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for\ncross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of\nintermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces\nmemory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding\ngradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been\nevaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In\nthis paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks\nconverge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information\nadheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these\nobservations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the\nrecently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the\nmatrix-based R\\'enyi's $\\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each\nlayer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to\nthe output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant\nrepresentations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training\nprocedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further\ndemonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign\nrecognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training\nbaselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD."}

Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness\ndirectly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and\nsignificant performance degradation."}
