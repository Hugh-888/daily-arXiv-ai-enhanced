Comments are welcome", "summary": "We present a fully analytical framework that unifies weak-field and\nstrong-deflection lensing of light in a time-dependent, perturbed Schwarzschild\nspacetime. The spacetime dynamics are modeled by a single, axisymmetric,\neven-parity quasinormal mode with $\\ell=2$, $m=0$ and complex frequency\n$\\omega$. Working to first order in a small perturbation amplitude while\nkeeping background null geodesics exact, we derive a time-dependent\nline-of-sight (Born) expression for the screen-plane deflection measured by a\nstatic observer at large radius. From the same integral, an asymptotic\nexpansion yields the familiar weak-field $1/b$ law with a ringdown-frequency\ncorrection that drives a harmonic centroid wobble, whereas a near-photon-sphere\nexpansion produces a time-dependent generalization of the logarithmic\nstrong-deflection limit with modulated coefficients, including a small\noscillation of the critical impact parameter. An observer tetrad built from the\nbackground static frame ensures that all screen-plane quantities like centroid\nmotion, multi-image hierarchy, and time delays, and photon-ring morphology are\ngauge-safe at first order. We provide explicit matching across regimes, showing\nthat the near-critical coefficients governing spacing and ring-radius\nmodulations are encoded in the same Born kernel that controls the weak-field\ncorrection. The result is a coherent, purely theoretical account of how\nringdown physics imprints on imaging observables without numerical ray tracing."}

These junctions, however, face several limitations that\nhinder their scalability: the small superconducting gap of aluminum\nnecessitates millikelvin operating temperatures, the material interfaces lead\nto dissipation, and the sandwich geometry adds unwelcome capacitance for\nhigh-frequency applications. In this work, we address all three limitations\nusing a novel superconducting weak link based on the superconductor-insulator\ntransition. By locally thinning a single film of niobium nitride, we exploit\nits thickness-driven superconductor-insulator transition to form a weak link\nemploying only atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching. We utilize our\nweak links to produce a transmon qubit, '$planaron$', with a measured\nanharmonicity of $\\alpha/2\\pi = 235$ MHz; at present, the linewidth is\n$\\kappa/2\\pi = 15 \\mathrm{\\: MHz}$. The high superconducting gap of niobium\nnitride can enable operation at elevated temperatures in future devices, and\nthe fully planar geometry of the weak link eliminates superfluous material\ninterfaces and capacitances.

Under the wavefunction collapse, the\nscale factor monotonically increases, thus acting as a clock. The scalar,\nvector, and tensor gravitons arise as physical excitations, and the arrow of\ntime for their evolution is set by the initial state. In the long-time limit,\nthe tensor gravitons exhibit emergent unitary dynamics. However, the extra\nmodes are strongly damped due to the non-unitary dynamics that suppress the\nconstraint-violating excitations. The vector mode is uniformly suppressed over\nall length scales, but the decay rate of the scalar is proportional to its wave\nvector.

Despite the rich structure of non-Markovian dynamics, their relevance\nto quantum information processing (QIP) has been rarely discussed. In this\nwork, we demonstrate that the negativity of the dynamics, a characteristic of\nnon-Markovian dynamics, naturally arises in quantum error correction (QEC) and\nquantum teleportation. The negativity in open quantum systems is naturally\nattributed to the information backflow from the environment. We partition the\nwhole Hilbert space into the logical subsystem and the gauge subsystem. The\nlogical subsystem stores the quantum information for QIP, while the gauge\nsubsystem stores the information for recovery of the logical information, i.e.,\nthe syndrome measurement outcomes for quantum error correction and Bell\nmeasurement outcomes for successful teleportation. We then show that the\nnegativity in quantum information processing appears as a consequence of the\nfeedback operation based on the measurement outcomes of the gauge subsystem.\nFinally, we show that the negativity of non-Markovianity in QIP reduces the\nsampling cost of quantum error mitigation (QEM), shedding light on the\nimportance of combination strategies of QEC and QEM in a practical QIP."}

Specifically, for gene expression datasets,\nit yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around\n10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such\ndatasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful\nselection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is\nreasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k\nnumber of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate\nnorm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier\npowered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema."}

This undermines their central purpose -- providing\ndiverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations\n-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc\nregularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We\nempirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and\nprototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training\nprototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without\nnecessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint\noptimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns\nprototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model\nprototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,\nindependent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling\neliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields\nconsistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance."}

To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that\ndynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL\nperforms a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies\nand prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data\nsubspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative\naggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.\nFurthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization\nstability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization\nmechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively\nmitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local\nperformance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable\nupdates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,\nCINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses\nstate-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,\nscalability and convergence stability."}

Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained\ninter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms\nsuch as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically\nrely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level\ncross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse\nmolecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement\nframework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph\nthat integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of\ninter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is\nthe potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling\nlong-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure\nconsistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the\nglobal structural context.

However, the connection\nbetween these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this\nwork, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on\nKLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to\njoint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based\ninformation increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.\nFurthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives\nand observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier\ntrained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational\nlower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound\nis tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to\nstate-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of\nestablished reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently\nprovides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also\ndemonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information\nBottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical\njustifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning\nin MI-based representation learning."}

In domains such as climate and healthcare,\nthese events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to\nserious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of\nsubstantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are\noptimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often\nstruggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or\nheart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of\nvaluable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme\nevents. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event\nforecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer\ninformation from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving\nprediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of\nexperts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert\nmodels across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting\nperformance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that\nxTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme\nevents improving from 3% to 78%."}

Despite these advances, accessible automated tools that\nallow users to construct, validate, and visualise datasets from scientific\nliterature extraction remain scarce. We therefore developed ComProScanner, an\nautonomous multi-agent platform that facilitates the extraction, validation,\nclassification, and visualisation of machine-readable chemical compositions and\nproperties, integrated with synthesis data from journal articles for\ncomprehensive database creation. We evaluated our framework using 100 journal\narticles against 10 different LLMs, including both open-source and proprietary\nmodels, to extract highly complex compositions associated with ceramic\npiezoelectric materials and corresponding piezoelectric strain coefficients\n(d33), motivated by the lack of a large dataset for such materials.\nDeepSeek-V3-0324 outperformed all models with a significant overall accuracy of\n0.82. This framework provides a simple, user-friendly, readily-usable package\nfor extracting highly complex experimental data buried in the literature to\nbuild machine learning or deep learning datasets."}
