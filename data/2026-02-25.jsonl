Although constraint-solving techniques can overcome some limitations of traditional testing and verification, they have not yet been sufficiently explored in the context of quantum programs. To address this gap, we present QSolver, the first quantum constraint solver. QSolver provides a structured framework for handling five types of quantum constraints and incorporates an automated assertion generation module to verify quantum states. QSolver transforms quantum programs and multi-moment constraints into symbolic representations, and utilizes an SMT solver to obtain quantum states that satisfy these constraints. To validate the correctness of the generated input states, QSolver automatically generates assertion programs corresponding to each constraint. Experimental results show that QSolver efficiently processes commonly used quantum gates and demonstrates good scalability across quantum programs of different sizes."}

Accurate modeling of these phenomena requires precise ab initio data for high-energy decay channels, specifically photoabsorption and photoelectron emission. These are computationally difficult for classical methods due to prohibitive scaling in simulating electron dynamics, or due to the inability to resolve the ionization continuum in an efficient manner. In this work, we present quantum simulation algorithms to compute these key observables. First, we introduce a coherent time-domain spectroscopy algorithm optimized to resolve the photoabsorption cross-section at the 92 eV operating frequency. Second, we develop a first-quantized plane-wave simulation to compute the photoelectron kinetic energy spectrum, utilizing real-time dynamics and energy windowing to treat bound and delocalized scattering states on equal footing. Additionally, we provide logical resource estimation for a model photoresist monomer, 4-iodo-2-methylphenol (IMePh), and demonstrate that 92 eV absorption sensitivity can be resolved using roughly $200$ logical qubits and $10^{9}$ total non-Clifford gates per circuit with approximately $10^3$ shots for the smallest instance. The more sophisticated photoemission algorithm that models the continuum explicitly, incurs gate costs of $\\geq 10^{13}$ total non-Clifford gates per circuit, $10^4$ shots, and requires a few thousand logical qubits. These results establish high-fidelity quantum simulations as a key component to parameterize the multi-scale macroscopic models required to overcome the electron blur bottleneck in semiconductor miniaturization."}

The union-find (UF) decoder for the surface code is widely regarded as a promising candidate, offering almost-linear time complexity and favorable empirical error suppression supported by numerical evidence. However, the lack of a rigorous threshold theorem has left open whether the UF decoder can achieve fault tolerance beyond the error models and parameter regimes tested in numerical simulations. Here, we provide a rigorous proof of a finite threshold for the UF decoder on the surface code under the circuit-level local stochastic error model. To this end, we develop a refined error-clustering framework that extends techniques previously used to analyze cellular-automaton and renormalization-group decoders, by showing that error clusters can be separated by substantially larger buffers, thereby enabling analytical control over the behavior of the UF decoder. Using this guarantee, we further prove a quasi-polylogarithmic upper bound on the average runtime of a parallel UF decoder in terms of the code size. We also show that this framework yields a finite threshold for the greedy decoder, a simpler decoder with lower complexity but weaker empirical error suppression. These results provide a solid theoretical foundation for the practical use of UF-based decoders in the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers, while offering a unified framework for studying fault tolerance across these practical decoders."}

Unlike approaches based on binary encoding, which require $N^2$ variables and penalty terms to enforce valid tour constraints, we adopt a permutation-based formulation with integer variables and use autoregressive sampling with masking to guarantee that every generated sample is a valid tour by construction. We also introduce a $k$-site MPS variant that learns distributions over $k$-grams (consecutive city subsequences) using a sliding window approach, enabling parameter-efficient modeling for larger instances. Experimental validation on TSPLIB benchmark instances with up to 52 cities demonstrates that TN-GEO can outperform classical heuristics including swap and 2-opt hill-climbing. The $k$-site variants, which put more focus on local correlations, show better results compared to the full-MPS case."}

Conventional TI schemes start from an NVT harmonic reference and require three successive corrections to recover the Gibbs free energy of the real crystal in the NPT ensemble.

Here, we present a rigorous (and only) two-step TI scheme that operates entirely in the NPT ensemble, eliminating the need for the approximate NVT-to-NPT step. The key methodological advancement is the novel NPT reference that explicitly accounts for full cell fluctuations. The new approach is compared with the conventional one via two complementary case studies. For ice polymorphs, having simple cell-shape distributions, the new approach reproduces conventional TI results with excellent agreement. For CsPbI3, whose black phase exhibits complex cell-shape behavior, we demonstrate that our novel method provides more accurate Gibbs free energy differences than the conventional one. Moreover, the proposed framework maintains comparable computational cost while offering a simplified workflow. Overall, the new NPT TI scheme provides rigorous and direct Gibbs free energy calculations for solids."}

Supplemental material included", "summary": "Protecting information against decoherence in open quantum systems remains a central challenge for quantum computing. In particular, passive error correction schemes have so far been limited to static memories rather than dynamical qubits. We demonstrate that a driven-dissipative bosonic system can encode a persistently oscillating qubit within a noiseless subsystem, realized explicitly in the Bose-Hubbard dimer (BHD). The strong parity symmetry of the model leads to degenerate stationary states. This symmetry is further broken into non-stationary states in the thermodynamic limit, which exhibit persistent oscillations. As the driving force increases, the Liouvillian spectrum of these states features a phase transition. Above the transition point, the non-stationary state encodes quantum information, preserving it in a noiseless subsystem. In addition to global loss that affects both bosonic modes identically, we further add global dephasing and show that the oscillating qubit is preserved. Finally, in order to gain additional physical insight, we study the effect of phase perturbation to both modes and observe that likewise they are passively protected, returning approximately to their initial configurations. These results establish dissipative time-crystalline dynamics as a mechanism for passive protection of dynamical quantum information, enabling autonomously stabilized oscillating qubits."}

We employ a toy model to describe the oscillatory dynamics and its coupling to the field modes, focusing on the resulting effects in the exterior spacetime of the star. The Bogoliubov coefficients relating the in and out vacua are computed non-perturbatively using high-precision numerical methods, without relying on weak-field, small-amplitude or small-velocity expansions.

However, during RL training, the enormous state space of MLLM and sparse rewards often leads to entropy collapse, policy degradation, or over-exploitation of suboptimal behaviors. This necessitates an exploration strategy that maintains productive stochasticity while avoiding the drawbacks of uncontrolled random sampling, yielding inefficient exploration. In this paper, we propose CalibRL, a hybrid-policy RLVR framework that supports controllable exploration with expert guidance, enabled by two key mechanisms. First, a distribution-aware advantage weighting scales updates by group rareness to calibrate the distribution, therefore preserving exploration. Meanwhile, the asymmetric activation function (LeakyReLU) leverages the expert knowledge as a calibration baseline to moderate overconfident updates while preserving their corrective direction. CalibRL increases policy entropy in a guided manner and clarifies the target distribution by estimating the on-policy distribution through online sampling. Updates are driven by these informative behaviors, avoiding convergence to erroneous patterns. Importantly, these designs help alleviate the distributional mismatch between the model's policy and expert trajectories, thereby achieving a more stable balance between exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks, including both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, demonstrate consistent improvements, validating the effectiveness of our controllable hybrid-policy RLVR training.

The influence of the MGR parameter on particle dynamics and effective potentials is analyzed, revealing non-trivial departures from simple Newtonian intuition.

Approaches that rely only on geometric distances risk removing informative samples and generating low-quality synthetic data, while binarization approaches treat imbalance locally and ignore global inter-class dependencies. At the algorithmic level, ensembles struggle to integrate weak classifiers, leading to limited robustness. This paper proposes IMOVNO+ (IMbalance-OVerlap-NOise+ Algorithm-Level Optimization), a two-level framework designed to jointly enhance data quality and algorithmic robustness for binary and multi-class tasks. At the data level, first, conditional probability is used to quantify the informativeness of each sample. Second, the dataset is partitioned into core, overlapping, and noisy regions. Third, an overlapping-cleaning algorithm is introduced that combines Z-score metrics with a big-jump gap distance. Fourth, a smart oversampling algorithm based on multi-regularization controls synthetic sample proximity, preventing new overlaps. At the algorithmic level, a meta-heuristic prunes ensemble classifiers to reduce weak-learner influence. IMOVNO+ was evaluated on 35 datasets (13 multi-class, 22 binary). Results show consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods, approaching 100% in several cases.

The protocol relies on two observables acquired with an electrical spectrum analyzer: the heterodyne beat-note power and the local oscillator shot-noise variance, with explicit treatment of the analyzer's equivalent noise bandwidth (ENBW). The photon flux in the signal path is referenced to SI units via calibrated radiometric standards. We first validate the protocol on a free-space receiver, demonstrating consistency with an independently constructed optical loss chain across a wide range of signal powers and under controlled, calibrated attenuation. Extending the same estimator to a fiber-coupled, polarization-maintaining balanced receiver confirms that the protocol is robust for practical coherent-receiver architectures and intermediate frequencies in the MHz range. These results establish a traceable, uncertainty-bounded framework for real-time receiver calibration, providing a practical route for CV-QKD and other coherent optical systems."}

Here we investigate a novel quantum probe of strong-field gravity: the gravitomagnetic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect for Cooper pairs propagating in Kerr spacetime. The frame-dragging induced by a rotating black hole (BH) generates an effective vector potential through the off-diagonal metric component $g_{tφ}$, which couples to the macroscopic phase of the superconducting condensate. We derive the gauge-invariant AB phase shift $Δθ= (4πm^* Ma/\\hbar)(1/r_2 - 1/r_1)$ for an interferometer with arms at radii $r_1$ and $r_2$, where $m^* = 2m_e$ is the Cooper pair mass and $a$ is the BH spin parameter. Remarkably, the predicted phases reach $|Δθ| \\sim 10^{24}$ radians for Sgr~A* and $\\sim 10^{27}$ radians for M87*, reflecting the enormous gravitomagnetic flux near supermassive BHs. We analyze the dependence on interferometer geometry, demonstrate that tidal disruption of Cooper pairs is negligible at distances $r \\gtrsim 10\\,r_s$, and establish connections to the geometric Berry phase. Although direct experimental realization remains beyond current technology due to the vast distances involved, our framework provides quantitative predictions linking quantum coherence to spacetime curvature, complementing recent observations of gravitational AB phases in atom interferometry."}

This process typically involves two stages: identifying the layer to edit and performing the parameter update. Intuitively, different queries may localize knowledge at different depths of the model, resulting in different sample-wise editing performance for a fixed editing layer. In this work, we hypothesize the existence of fixed golden layers that can achieve near-optimal editing performance similar to sample-wise optimal layers. To validate this hypothesis, we provide empirical evidence by comparing golden layers against ground-truth sample-wise optimal layers. Furthermore, we show that golden layers can be reliably identified using a proxy dataset and generalize effectively to unseen test set queries across datasets. Finally, we propose a novel method, namely Layer Gradient Analysis (LGA) that estimates golden layers efficiently via gradient-attribution, avoiding extensive trial-and-error across multiple editing runs. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our LGA approach across different LLM types and various knowledge editing methods."}

MMPFN comprises per-modality encoders, modality projectors, and pre-trained foundation models. The modality projectors serve as the critical bridge, transforming non-tabular embeddings into tabular-compatible tokens for unified processing.

We further demonstrate that dynamical decoupling (DD) remains effective within this unified framework, and that a decoherence-free subspace (DFS) -- like structure emerges. Unlike previous approximate treatments, our analytically solvable IPQ-Bath model enables rigorous testing of these strategies, with numerical simulations validating their effectiveness."}

Yet the increasing complexity of logistics networks, spanning multimodal transportation, cross-country routing, and pronounced regional variability, makes this prediction task inherently challenging. This paper introduces a multi-task deep learning model for delivery delay duration prediction in the presence of significant imbalanced data, where delayed shipments are rare but operationally consequential. The model embeds high-dimensional shipment features with dedicated embedding layers for tabular data, and then uses a classification-then-regression strategy to predict the delivery delay duration for on-time and delayed shipments. Unlike sequential pipelines, this approach enables end-to-end training, improves the detection of delayed cases, and supports probabilistic forecasting for uncertainty-aware decision making. The proposed approach is evaluated on a large-scale real-world dataset from an industrial partner, comprising more than 10 million historical shipment records across four major source locations with distinct regional characteristics. The proposed model is compared with traditional machine learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a mean absolute error of 0.67-0.91 days for delayed-shipment predictions, outperforming single-step tree-based regression baselines by 41-64% and two-step classify-then-regress tree-based models by 15-35%. These gains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in operational delivery delay forecasting under highly imbalanced and heterogeneous conditions."}

The ratio of inactive qubits to total qubits and the population in the excited state of the qubits are employed to characterize the aging transition. We find a transition where the population in the excited states suddenly drops when the ratio exceeds a threshold.

We reconcile these views with the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: the representational space contains directions ranging from broadly domain-general to narrowly domain-specific. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate probe generalization across five truth types (definitional, empirical, logical, fictional, and ethical), sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying, and existing honesty benchmarks. Linear probes generalize well across most domains but fail on sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying. Yet training on all domains jointly recovers strong performance, confirming that domain-general directions exist despite poor pairwise transfer. The geometry of probe directions explains these patterns: Mahalanobis cosine similarity between probes near-perfectly predicts cross-domain generalization (R^2=0.98). Concept-erasure methods further isolate truth directions that are (1) domain-general, (2) domain-specific, or (3) shared only across particular domain subsets. Causal interventions reveal that domain-specific directions steer more effectively than domain-general ones. Finally, post-training reshapes truth geometry, pushing sycophantic lying further from other truth types, suggesting a representational basis for chat models' sycophantic tendencies. Together, our results support the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: truth directions of varying generality coexist in representational space, with post-training reshaping their geometry.

Aging transitions in coupled oscillators have been studied extensively in both the classical and quantum contexts. It is well known that the onset of aging transitions can be modulated by the dissipative coupling between oscillators. In this study, we propose an alternative way to modulate the aging transition through coherent couplings between a two-level atom and the oscillators. Our findings reveal that, compared to atom-free systems in both classical and quantum regimes, the atom-oscillator coherent interaction reduces the inactive-to-total oscillator ratio required for aging transitions. Analytical results of the transition for both the classical oscillators and quantum oscillators suggest that the decay rate of the atom and the atom-oscillator coupling strength jointly change the aging transition point. The physics behind the observation is also elucidated in this article.

We propose a two-step framework that decouples geometric representation from learning the physics response, to enable shape-informed surrogate modeling under data-scarce conditions. First, a shape model learns a compact latent representation of left ventricular geometries. The learned latent space effectively encodes anatomies and enables synthetic geometries generation for data augmentation. Second, a neural field-based surrogate model, conditioned on this geometric encoding, is trained to predict ventricular displacement under external loading. The proposed architecture performs positional encoding by using universal ventricular coordinates, which improves generalization across diverse anatomies. Geometric variability is encoded using two alternative strategies, which are systematically compared: a PCA-based approach suitable for working with point cloud representations of geometries, and a DeepSDF-based implicit neural representation learned directly from point clouds. Overall, our results, obtained on idealized and patient-specific datasets, show that the proposed approaches allow for accurate predictions and generalization to unseen geometries, and robustness to noisy or sparsely sampled inputs."}

However, standard Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are often constrained by limited ansatz expressivity and difficult optimization landscapes. To address these issues, we adopt a geometric perspective, formulating the problem as the minimization of an energy cost function directly over the unitary group. We establish a retraction-based Riemannian optimization framework for this setting, ensuring that all algorithmic procedures are implementable on quantum hardware. Within this framework, we unify existing randomized gradient approaches under a Riemannian Random Subspace Gradient Projection (RRSGP) method. While recent geometric approaches have predominantly focused on such first-order gradient descent techniques, efficient second-order methods remain unexplored. To bridge this gap, we derive explicit expressions for the Riemannian Hessian and show that it can be estimated directly on quantum hardware via parameter-shift rules. Building on this, we propose the Riemannian Random Subspace Newton (RRSN) method, a scalable second-order algorithm that constructs a Newton system from measurement data. Numerical simulations indicate that RRSN achieves quadratic convergence, yielding high-precision ground states in significantly fewer iterations compared to both existing first-order approaches and standard VQA baselines. Ultimately, this work provides a systematic foundation for applying a broader class of efficient Riemannian algorithms to quantum circuit design."}

To address these bottlenecks, we introduce QuantVLA, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that, to our knowledge, is the first PTQ approach for VLA systems and the first to successfully quantize a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head. QuantVLA incorporates three scale-calibrated components: (1) a selective quantization layout that integerizes all linear layers in both the language backbone and the DiT while keeping attention projections in floating point to preserve the original operator schedule; (2) attention temperature matching, a lightweight per-head scaling mechanism that stabilizes attention logits and is folded into the dequantization scales at inference; and (3) output head balancing, a per-layer residual interface calibration that mitigates post-projection energy drift. The framework requires no additional training, uses only a small unlabeled calibration buffer, and supports integer kernels for low-bit weights and activations while leaving the architecture unchanged. Across representative VLA models on LIBERO, QuantVLA exceeds the task success rates of full-precision baselines, achieves about 70% relative memory savings on the quantized components, and delivers a 1.22x speedup in end-to-end inference latency, providing a practical pathway toward scalable low-bit embodied intelligence under strict compute, memory, and power constraints."}

A qutrit is encoded using two physical qubits to represent the atomic states, while an additional qubit encodes the truncated field mode, enabling the realization of effective $Λ$-type atomic dynamics.The continuous-time light-matter interaction is implemented in a digital form by discretizing the evolution using Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. In contrast to an analog realization, the digital simulation replaces the continuous evolution with a sequence of quantum gates whose parameters are explicitly controlled. Phase evolution arising from the interaction Hamiltonian is digitally encoded using calibrated $R_Z$ gates, whose rotation angles are fixed by the physically relevant coupling scale and the chosen Trotter time step.State preparation is achieved using Hadamard and parametrized rotation gates, while the interaction dynamics are implemented through controlled operations. A comparative analysis between first- and second-order Trotter implementations reveals a trade-off between digital accuracy and hardware-induced noise.

Our analysis reveals that reasoning manifests as a transient geometric pulse, where concept manifolds are untangled into linearly separable subspaces immediately prior to computation and rapidly compressed thereafter. This behavior diverges from standard linear probe accuracy, which remains high long after computation, suggesting a fundamental distinction between information that is merely retrievable and information that is geometrically prepared for processing.

Traditional designs optimize these resources for individual tasks, neglecting that multiple tasks may arrive concurrently and compete for the same entanglement. We introduce compatibility as a design-level metric, capturing whether concurrent tasks can be satisfied by the same entanglement resources. We define a worst-case notion of compatibility where nodes are prevented from coordinating after task arrival and illustrate why tasks may be incompatible. Furthermore, we explore compatibility extensions that account for stochastic arrivals and the capability to supplement the pre-shared entanglement with additional entanglement on-demand, and show that incompatibility differs structurally dependent on the set of concurrent tasks. We argue that compatibility should be used for resource state design, building the foundation for determining which task pairs the network should support with pre-shared entanglement and which require execution-time coordination. Numerical simulations demonstrate this potential, with $(G,1)$-compatibility achieving a 40%-55% gain in simultaneously supported tasks relative to the single-task baseline. By incorporating compatibility as a fundamental design objective, quantum networks can move beyond single-task optimization towards scalable, robust architectures that effectively balance proactive entanglement distribution and supplemental reactive coordination."}

In this work, we propose Graph Semantic Predictive Network (GraSPNet), a hierarchical self-supervised framework that explicitly models both atomic-level and fragment-level semantics. GraSPNet decomposes molecular graphs into chemically meaningful fragments without predefined vocabularies and learns node- and fragment-level representations through multi-level message passing with masked semantic prediction at both levels. This hierarchical semantic supervision enables GraSPNet to learn multi-resolution structural information that is both expressive and transferable. Extensive experiments on multiple molecular property prediction benchmarks demonstrate that GraSPNet learns chemically meaningful representations and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GSSL methods in transfer learning settings."}

We introduce Momentum Guidance (MG), a new dimension of guidance that leverages the ODE trajectory itself. MG extrapolates the current velocity using an exponential moving average of past velocities and preserves the standard one-evaluation-per-step cost. It matches the effect of standard guidance without extra computation and can further improve quality when combined with CFG. Experiments demonstrate MG's effectiveness across benchmarks. Specifically, on ImageNet-256, MG achieves average improvements in FID of 36.68% without CFG and 25.52% with CFG across various sampling settings, attaining an FID of 1.597 at 64 sampling steps.

Later works in approximation theory provide quantitative approximation rates for ReLU networks on the class of $α$-Hölder functions $f: [0,1]^N \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The goal of this paper is to provide similar quantitative approximation results in the context of group equivariant learning, where the learned $α$-Hölder function is known to obey certain group symmetries. While there has been much interest in the literature in understanding the universal approximation properties of equivariant models, very few quantitative approximation results are known for equivariant models.\n  In this paper, we bridge this gap by deriving quantitative approximation rates for several prominent group-equivariant and invariant architectures. The architectures that we consider include: the permutation-invariant Deep Sets architecture; the permutation-equivariant Sumformer and Transformer architectures; joint invariance to permutations and rigid motions using invariant networks based on frame averaging; and general bi-Lipschitz invariant models. Overall, we show that equally-sized ReLU MLPs and equivariant architectures are equally expressive over equivariant functions. Thus, hard-coding equivariance does not result in a loss of expressivity or approximation power in these models."}

Within a semi-supervised learning framework, we incorporate multiple layers of transposed convolutions in the generator, enabling the conditional GAN to more efficiently extract low-dimensional encoded information. Analysis of one-dimensional latent variables associated with ground-state samples for different system sizes allows us to pinpoint the location of the critical point.

Causal knowledge about the data-generating process is required to identify and correct such misleading feature attributions. We propose cc-Shapley (causal context Shapley), an interventional modification of conventional observational Shapley values leveraging knowledge of the data's causal structure, thereby analyzing the relevance of a feature in the causal context of the remaining features. We show theoretically that this eradicates spurious association induced by collider bias. We compare the behavior of Shapley and cc-Shapley values on various, synthetic, and real-world datasets.

Despite various quantum algorithms have been developed, many of them often require strong input assumptions, which is hardware demanding. In particular, recent advances on dequantization have revealed that the quantum advantage is more of a mere artifact of strong input assumptions. In this work, we propose a variant of these algorithms, leveraging both classical and quantum resources. Provided the classical knowledge (the entries) of the matrix/vector of interest, a classical procedure is used to pre-process this information. Then they are fed into a quantum circuit which is shown to be a block encoding of the matrix of interest. From this block-encoding, we show how to use it to tackle a wide range of problems, including principal component analysis, linear equation solving, Hamiltonian simulation, preparing ground state, and data fitting. We also analyze our protocol, showing that both the classical and quantum procedure can achieve logarithmic complexity in the input dimension, thus implying its potential for near term realization. We then discuss several implications and corollaries of our result. First,, our results suggest there are certain matrices/Hamiltonians where our method can provide exponential improvement compared to the existing ones with respect to the sparsity. Regarding dense linear systems, our method achieves exponential speed-up with respect to the inverse of error tolerance, compared to the best previously known quantum algorithm for dense systems. Last, and most importantly, regarding quantum data fitting, we show how the output of our quantum algorithms can be leveraged to predict unseen data. Thus, it provides an end-to-end application, which has been an open aspect of the previous quantum data fitting algorithm."}

Unlike many real-world datasets, they often (1) have no features with more salience than truthfulness, (2) have balanced training sets, and (3) contain only data points to which the model can give a well-defined answer. We construct datasets that lack each of these properties to stress-test a range of standard unsupervised elicitation and easy-to-hard generalization techniques. We find that no technique reliably performs well on any of these challenges. We also study ensembling and combining easy-to-hard and unsupervised techniques, and find they only partially mitigate performance degradation due to these challenges.

Consequently, accurate model estimation depends on how the exploration policy allocates visitation frequencies in accordance with the intrinsic complexity of each transition distribution. Building on recent work on coverage-based exploration, we introduce a parameterized family of decomposable and concave objective functions $U_κ$ that explicitly incorporate both intrinsic estimation complexity and extrinsic visitation frequency. Moreover, the curvature $κ$ provides a unified treatment of various global objectives, such as the average-case and worst-case estimation error objectives. Using the closed-form characterization of the gradient of $U_κ$, we propose $κ$-Explorer, an active exploration algorithm that performs Frank-Wolfe-style optimization over state-action occupancy measures. The diminishing-returns structure of $U_κ$ naturally prioritizes underexplored and high-variance transitions, while preserving smoothness properties that enable efficient optimization. We establish tight regret guarantees for $κ$-Explorer and further introduce a fully online and computationally efficient surrogate algorithm for practical use. Experiments on benchmark MDPs demonstrate that $κ$-Explorer provides superior performance compared to existing exploration strategies."}

Motivated by the recent emergence of electron microscopy methods capable of sensing microwave-excitations, we establish a theoretical framework for Spin Resonance Spectroscopy (SRS) in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This technique combines microwave pump fields with focused electron probe beams to enable state-selective spin imaging at the atomic scale. Using scattering theory, we model the interaction between free-space electrons and electron spin systems, capturing both elastic and inelastic processes. The strongest effect of the spin system on the free electron is a magnetic phase shift. Our simulations demonstrate that phase shifts from individual electron spins are detectable in both image mode and diffraction mode. In principle, differential measurements under microwave control allow the extraction of local resonance frequencies that are influenced by the surrounding spin environment. By evaluating the Classical Fisher Information (CFI), we identify imaging conditions that maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), showing how defocus and beam width affect the measurement sensitivity. These findings establish a foundation for integrating SRS with high-resolution TEM, bridging spin spectroscopy and atomic-scale imaging, and enabling new capabilities in quantum spin research and nanoscale materials characterization."}

However, deploying large-scale GNN models locally is particularly challenging for users, as it requires significant computational resources and extensive property data. Consequently, Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has become increasingly popular, offering a convenient way to deploy and access various models, including GNNs. However, an emerging threat known as Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs) presents significant risks, as adversaries can readily obtain surrogate GNN models exhibiting similar functionality. Specifically, attackers repeatedly query the target model using subgraph inputs to collect corresponding responses. These input-output pairs are subsequently utilized to train their own surrogate models at minimal cost. Many techniques have been proposed to defend against MEAs, but most are limited to specific output levels (e.g., embedding or label) and suffer from inherent technical drawbacks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel ownership verification framework CITED which is a first-of-its-kind method to achieve ownership verification on both embedding and label levels. Moreover, CITED is a novel signature-based method that neither harms downstream performance nor introduces auxiliary models that reduce efficiency, while still outperforming all watermarking and fingerprinting approaches.

This modified VQE pairs a low-depth circuit with an energy-selective objective that explicitly penalizes energy variance around a chosen target energy. The cost function exploits the limited expressibility of the shallow circuit as atypical low-entanglement eigenstates such as scar states are preferentially selected. We validate this mechanism across two complementary families of models that contain many-body scar states: the Shiraishi-Mori embedding approach, and the matrix-product state parent Hamiltonian construction. We define an unbiased estimation scheme for the nonlinear cost function that is compatible with qubit-wise commuting grouping and bitstring reuse.

By representing schedules as continuous Gaussian variables, we successfully capture the ordinal nature of time and reduce the optimization space by orders of magnitude. Our method is highly flexible to represent various objectives and constraints, which provides the first differentiable formulation for the complex pipelined scheduling problem.

Here, we demonstrate that moving beyond conventional radiation-pressure interactions and exploiting quadratic coupling can surpass these limits, generating intrinsic squeezing and non-Gaussian features in the probe state. We study quantum thermometry and magnetometry in a coupled two-resonator system, focusing on the estimation of a thermal bath temperature and an external magnetic field. The resonators are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with a common bath, while a weak magnetic field acts on one of the resonators. We perform measurements on a single resonator, which serves as the probe for estimating both parameters. We compute the quantum Fisher information of the probe for two different interaction models between the resonators. Our results show that the counter-rotating terms in the quadratic interaction naturally induce squeezing at intermediate coupling and strong non-Gaussian correlations as the coupling increases further. These effects yield orders-of-magnitude enhancement in sensitivity in the low-temperature and weak-field regimes compared to standard radiation-pressure couplings. Finally, we investigate multiparameter estimation and find that, although the optimal measurements remain compatible, statistical correlations between parameters prevent the simultaneous estimation of temperature and magnetic field from attaining single-parameter precision."}

However, EHRs are often sparse and contain missing data due to various challenges and limitations in data collection and sharing between healthcare providers. Existing techniques for imputing missing values predominantly focus on known unknowns, such as missing or unavailable values of lab test results; most do not explicitly address situations where it is difficult to distinguish what is missing. For instance, a missing diagnosis code in an EHR could signify either that the patient has not been diagnosed with the condition or that a diagnosis was made, but not shared by a provider. Such situations fall into the paradigm of unknown unknowns. To address this challenge, we develop a general purpose algorithm for denoising data to recover unknown missing values in binary EHRs. We design a transformer-based denoising neural network where the output is thresholded adaptively to recover values in cases where we predict data are missing. Our results demonstrate improved accuracy in denoising medical codes within a real EHR dataset compared to existing imputation approaches and leads to increased performance on downstream tasks using the denoised data. In particular, when applying our method to a real world application, predicting hospital readmission from EHRs, our method achieves statistically significant improvement over all existing baselines."}

In this work, we begin by directly comparing how the distribution of information stored across layers of attention heads differs between the protein and natural language domain. Furthermore, we adapt a simple early-exit technique-originally used in the natural language domain to improve efficiency at the cost of performance-to achieve both increased accuracy and substantial efficiency gains in protein non-structural property prediction by allowing the model to automatically select protein representations from the intermediate layers of the PLMs for the specific task and protein at hand. We achieve performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 7.01 percentage points while simultaneously improving efficiency by over 10 percent across models and non-structural prediction tasks.

Quantum devices that provide both outcomes can be described through quantum instruments. In a realistic scenario, one can expect that the observer's obtained classical and quantum outcomes are non-ideal: this can be due to experimental limitations, but could also be explained by adversarial interference, that is, a second party that disturbs the device through a concealed measurement to obtain information. The second scenario can be interpreted through quantum compatibility, as it implies that both the observer's instrument and the adversary's measurement can be performed simultaneously. In this work, we show how the noise of the observer's device relates to the amount of information that the adversary can obtain. We study scenarios in which the adversary aims to acquire information on the same basis as the observer's measurement, or on a mutually unbiased basis with respect to the observer's basis. In both cases, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the compatibility of a single qubit non-ideal quantum instrument and a noisy meter, from which we obtain the maximum amount of information that the adversary can extract in terms of the noise parameters of the observer's instrument. Finally, we provide the device implementation from the adversary's point of view for the same basis scenario."}

However, the learning process tends to be costly. To address this, we present a novel paradigm named Attention Neural Teaching (AtteNT) that reinterprets the learning process through a nonparametric teaching perspective. Specifically, the latter provides a theoretical framework for teaching mappings that are implicitly defined (i.e., nonparametric) via example selection. Such an implicit mapping is embodied through a dense set of sequence-property pairs, with the AtteNT teacher selecting a subset to accelerate convergence in attention learner training. By analytically investigating the role of attention on parameter-based gradient descent during training, and recasting the evolution of attention learners, shaped by parameter updates, through functional gradient descent in nonparametric teaching, we show for the first time that teaching attention learners is consistent with teaching importance-adaptive nonparametric learners. These new findings readily commit AtteNT to enhancing learning efficiency of attention learners. Specifically, we observe training time reductions of 13.01% for LLMs and 20.58% for ViTs, spanning both fine-tuning and training-from-scratch regimes. Crucially, these gains are achieved without compromising accuracy; in fact, performance is consistently preserved and often enhanced across a diverse set of downstream tasks."}

Pruning techniques affirmed themselves as valid tools to extract sparse representations of neural networks parameters, carefully balancing between compression and preservation of information. However, a fundamental assumption behind pruning is that expendable weights should have small impact on the error of the network, while highly important weights should tend to have a larger influence on the inference. We argue that this idea could be generalized; what if a weight is not simply removed but also compensated with a perturbation of the adjacent bias, which does not contribute to the network sparsity? Our work introduces a novel pruning method in which the importance measure of each weight is computed considering the output behavior after an optimal perturbation of its adjacent bias, efficiently computable by automatic differentiation. These perturbations can be then applied directly after the removal of each weight, independently of each other. After deriving analytical expressions for the aforementioned quantities, numerical experiments are conducted to benchmark this technique against some of the most popular pruning strategies, demonstrating an intrinsic efficiency of the proposed approach in very diverse machine learning scenarios.

However, the evolving inter-variable dependencies and inevitable noise render it challenging. Existing methods often use single-scale graphs or instance-level contrast. Moreover, learned dynamic graphs can overfit noise without a stable anchor, causing false alarms or misses. To address these challenges, we propose the CGSTA framework with two key innovations. First, Dynamic Layered Graph Construction (DLGC) forms local, regional, and global views of variable relations for each sliding window; rather than contrasting whole windows, Contrastive Discrimination across Scales (CDS) contrasts graph representations within each view and aligns the same window across views to make learning structure-aware. Second, Stability-Aware Alignment (SAA) maintains a per-scale stable reference learned from normal data and guides the current window's fast-changing graphs toward it to suppress noise. We fuse the multi-scale and temporal features and use a conditional density estimator to produce per-time-step anomaly scores.

Real-world human emotional experiences, by contrast, are often characterized by the simultaneous presence of multiple affective states, spurring recent interest in mixed emotion recognition as an emotion distribution learning problem. Current approaches, however, often neglect the valence consistency and structured correlations inherent among coexisting emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a Memory-guided Prototypical Co-occurrence Learning (MPCL) framework that explicitly models emotion co-occurrence patterns. Specifically, we first fuse multi-modal signals via a multi-scale associative memory mechanism. To capture cross-modal semantic relationships, we construct emotion-specific prototype memory banks, yielding rich physiological and behavioral representations, and employ prototype relation distillation to ensure cross-modal alignment in the latent prototype space. Furthermore, inspired by human cognitive memory systems, we introduce a memory retrieval strategy to extract semantic-level co-occurrence associations across emotion categories. Through this bottom-up hierarchical abstraction process, our model learns affectively informative representations for accurate emotion distribution prediction. Comprehensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that MPCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in mixed emotion recognition, both quantitatively and qualitatively."}

In Bayesian inverse problems, this could be achieved by evaluating the model evidence $p(y \\mid M)$ under different models $M$ that specify the prior and then selecting the one with the highest value. Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art approach to solving inverse problems with a data-driven prior; however, directly computing the model evidence with respect to a diffusion prior is intractable. Furthermore, most existing model evidence estimators require either many pointwise evaluations of the unnormalized prior density or an accurate clean prior score. We propose \\method, an estimator of the model evidence of a diffusion prior by integrating over the time-marginals of posterior sampling methods. Our method leverages the large amount of intermediate samples naturally obtained during the reverse diffusion sampling process to obtain an accurate estimation of the model evidence using only a handful of posterior samples (e.g., 20). We also demonstrate how to implement our estimator in tandem with recent diffusion posterior sampling methods. Empirically, our estimator matches the model evidence when it can be computed analytically, and it is able to both select the correct diffusion model prior and diagnose prior misfit under different highly ill-conditioned, non-linear inverse problems, including a real-world black hole imaging problem."}

However, most methods search within a discrete equation space, where the structural modifications of equations rarely align with their numerical behavior, leaving fitting error feedback too noisy to guide exploration. To address this challenge, we propose GenSR, a generative latent space-based SR framework following the `map construction -> coarse localization -> fine search'' paradigm. Specifically, GenSR first pretrains a dual-branch Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to reparameterize symbolic equations into a generative latent space with symbolic continuity and local numerical smoothness. This space can be regarded as a well-structured `map'' of the equation space, providing directional signals for search. At inference, the CVAE coarsely localizes the input data to promising regions in the latent space. Then, a modified CMA-ES refines the candidate region, leveraging smooth latent gradients. From a Bayesian perspective, GenSR reframes the SR task as maximizing the conditional distribution $p(\\mathrm{Equ.} \\mid \\mathrm{Num.})$, with CVAE training achieving this objective through the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). This new perspective provides a theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of GenSR. Extensive experiments show that GenSR jointly optimizes predictive accuracy, expression simplicity, and computational efficiency, while remaining robust under noise."}

Our approach employs a tensor network Born machine based on automatically differentiable matrix product states (MPS) as the generative model, using the Born rule to define probability distributions over candidate solutions. Unlike approaches based on binary encoding, which require $N^2$ variables and penalty terms to enforce valid tour constraints, we adopt a permutation-based formulation with integer variables and use autoregressive sampling with masking to guarantee that every generated sample is a valid tour by construction. We also introduce a $k$-site MPS variant that learns distributions over $k$-grams (consecutive city subsequences) using a sliding window approach, enabling parameter-efficient modeling for larger instances. Experimental validation on TSPLIB benchmark instances with up to 52 cities demonstrates that TN-GEO can outperform classical heuristics including swap and 2-opt hill-climbing.

While convergence properties of such methods are well understood, their finite-iteration stability and generalization behavior remain unclear due to structural bias induced by column-stochastic mixing and asymmetric error propagation. In this work, we develop a unified uniform-stability framework for the Stochastic Gradient Push (SGP) algorithm that captures the effect of directed topology. A key technical ingredient is an imbalance-aware consistency bound for Push-Sum, which controls consensus deviation through two quantities: the stationary distribution imbalance parameter $δ$ and the spectral gap $(1-λ)$ governing mixing speed. This decomposition enables us to disentangle statistical effects from topology-induced bias. We establish finite-iteration stability and optimization guarantees for both convex objectives and non-convex objectives satisfying the Polyak--Łojasiewicz condition. For convex problems, SGP attains excess generalization error of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{mn}}+\\fracγ{δ(1-λ)}+γ\\right)$ under step-size schedules, and we characterize the corresponding optimal early stopping time that minimizes this bound.

These graphs can subsequently be used to train geometric DL models like GNN. GNN learns the inherent structural relationships within a molecule rather than depending on fixed-size fingerprints. Although GNN are powerful aggregators, their efficacy on smaller datasets and inductive biases across different architectures is less studied. In our present study, we performed a systematic benchmarking of four different GNN architectures across a diverse domain of datasets (physical chemistry, biological, and analytical).

A Feature-Based Triggerless Backdoor Attack in Vertical Federated Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "As a distributed collaborative machine learning paradigm, vertical federated learning (VFL) allows multiple passive parties with distinct features and one active party with labels to collaboratively train a model. Although it is known for the privacy-preserving capabilities, VFL still faces significant privacy and security threats from backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks typically involve an attacker implanting a trigger into the model during the training phase and executing the attack by adding the trigger to the samples during the inference phase. However, in this paper, we find that triggers are not essential for backdoor attacks in VFL. In light of this, we disclose a new backdoor attack pathway in VFL by introducing a feature-based triggerless backdoor attack. This attack operates under a more stringent security assumption, where the attacker is honest-but-curious rather than malicious during the training phase. It comprises three modules: label inference for the targeted backdoor attack, poison generation with amplification and perturbation mechanisms, and backdoor execution to implement the attack. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our attack outperforms three baseline backdoor attacks by 2 to 50 times while minimally impacting the main task. Even in VFL scenarios with 32 passive parties and only one set of auxiliary data, our attack maintains high performance. Moreover, when confronted with distinct defense strategies, our attack remains largely unaffected and exhibits strong robustness. We hope that the disclosure of this triggerless backdoor attack pathway will encourage the community to revisit security threats in VFL scenarios and inspire researchers to develop more robust and practical defense strategies."}

While AI for Science has witnessed the transformative power of foundation models in disciplines like genomics and meteorology, urban computing remains fragmented due to \"scenario-specific\" models, which are overfitted to specific regions or tasks, hindering their generalizability. To bridge this gap and advance spatio-temporal foundation models for urban systems, we adopt scaling as the central perspective and systematically investigate two key questions: what to scale and how to scale. Grounded in first-principles analysis, we identify three critical dimensions: heterogeneity, correlation, and dynamics, aligning these principles with the fundamental scientific properties of urban spatio-temporal data. Specifically, to address heterogeneity through data scaling, we construct WorldST. This billion-scale corpus standardizes diverse physical signals, such as traffic flow and speed, from over 100 global cities into a unified data format. To enable computation scaling for modeling correlations, we introduce the MiniST unit, a novel split mechanism that discretizes continuous spatio-temporal fields into learnable computational units to unify representations of grid-based and sensor-based observations. Finally, addressing dynamics via architecture scaling, we propose UrbanFM, a minimalist self-attention architecture designed with limited inductive biases to autonomously learn dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies from massive data. Furthermore, we establish EvalST, the largest-scale urban spatio-temporal benchmark to date.

This study presents WeirNet, a large 3D CFD benchmark dataset for geometric surrogate modeling of PKWs.

Push-forward generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational auto-encoders and normalising flows offer a computationally efficient alternative for posterior sampling. However, push-forward models are opaque as they lack the modularity of Bayes Theorem, leading to poor generalisation with respect to changes in the likelihood function. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to GAN architecture design by applying deep unfolding to Langevin MCMC algorithms. This paradigm maps fixed-step iterative algorithms onto modular neural networks, yielding architectures that are both flexible and amenable to interpretation. Crucially, our design allows key model parameters to be specified at inference time, offering robustness to changes in the likelihood parameters. We train these unfolded samplers end-to-end using a supervised regularized Wasserstein GAN framework for posterior sampling. Through extensive Bayesian imaging experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves high sampling accuracy and excellent computational efficiency, while retaining the physics consistency, adaptability and interpretability of classical MCMC strategies."}

Energy Demand Forecasting (EDF) of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipments (EVSEs) is one of the most critical operations for ensuring efficient energy management and sustainability, since it enables utility providers to anticipate energy/power demand, optimize resource allocation, and implement proactive measures to improve grid reliability. However, accurate EDF is a challenging problem due to external factors, such as the varying user routines, weather conditions, driving behaviors, unknown state of charge, etc. Furthermore, as concerns and restrictions about privacy and sustainability have grown, training data has become increasingly fragmented, resulting in distributed datasets scattered across different data silos and/or edge devices, calling for federated learning solutions. In this paper, we investigate different well-established time series forecasting methodologies to address the EDF problem, from statistical methods (the ARIMA family) to traditional machine learning models (such as XGBoost) and deep neural networks (GRU and LSTM). We provide an overview of these methods through a performance comparison over four real-world EVSE datasets, evaluated under both centralized and federated learning paradigms, focusing on the trade-offs between forecasting fidelity, privacy preservation, and energy overheads. Our experimental results demonstrate, on the one hand, the superiority of gradient boosted trees (XGBoost) over statistical and NN-based models in both prediction accuracy and energy efficiency and, on the other hand, an insight that Federated Learning-enabled models balance these factors, offering a promising direction for decentralized energy demand forecasting."}

Within this framework, we derive a closed-form analysis of adaptability, memorability, and generalization from the perspective of rehearsal scale. Our results uncover several intriguing and counterintuitive findings. First, rehearsal can impair model's adaptability, in sharp contrast to its traditionally recognized benefits. Second, increasing the rehearsal scale does not necessarily improve memory retention. When tasks are similar and noise levels are low, the memory error exhibits a diminishing lower bound. Finally, we validate these insights through numerical simulations and extended analyses on deep neural networks across multiple real-world datasets, revealing statistical patterns of rehearsal mechanisms in continual learning."}

By deriving the optimal parameter update magnitude that minimizes forgetting, we unify two representative update paradigms, frozen training and initialized training, within an optimization framework for constrained parameter updates. Our theoretical results further reveals that sequence tasks with small parameter distances exhibit better generalization and less forgetting under frozen training rather than initialized training. These theoretical insights inspire a novel hybrid parameter update strategy that adaptively adjusts update magnitude based on gradient directions. Experiments on deep neural networks demonstrate that this hybrid approach outperforms standard training strategies, providing new theoretical perspectives and practical inspiration for designing efficient and scalable continual learning algorithms."}

Genuinely solving such tasks requires Dec-POMDP reasoning, where agents use history to infer hidden states and coordinate based on local information. Yet it remains unclear whether popular benchmarks actually demand this reasoning or permit success via simpler strategies. We introduce a diagnostic suite combining statistically grounded performance comparisons and information-theoretic probes to audit the behavioural complexity of baseline policies (IPPO and MAPPO) across 37 scenarios spanning MPE, SMAX, Overcooked, Hanabi, and MaBrax. Our diagnostics reveal that success on these benchmarks rarely requires genuine Dec-POMDP reasoning. Reactive policies match the performance of memory-based agents in over half the scenarios, and emergent coordination frequently relies on brittle, synchronous action coupling rather than robust temporal influence. These findings suggest that some widely used benchmarks may not adequately test core Dec-POMDP assumptions under current training paradigms, potentially leading to over-optimistic assessments of progress. We release our diagnostic tooling to support more rigorous environment design and evaluation in cooperative MARL."}

While RL agents require extensive self-play games to extract useful signals, humans often need only a few games, improving rapidly by repeatedly revisiting states where mistakes occurred. This idea, known as search control, aims to restart from valuable states rather than always from the initial state. In AlphaZero, prior work Go-Exploit applies this idea by sampling past states from self-play or search trees, but it treats all states equally, regardless of their learning potential. We propose Regret-Guided Search Control (RGSC), which extends AlphaZero with a regret network that learns to identify high-regret states, where the agent's evaluation diverges most from the actual outcome. These states are collected from both self-play trajectories and MCTS nodes, stored in a prioritized regret buffer, and reused as new starting positions. Across 9x9 Go, 10x10 Othello, and 11x11 Hex, RGSC outperforms AlphaZero and Go-Exploit by an average of 77 and 89 Elo, respectively. When training on a well-trained 9x9 Go model, RGSC further improves the win rate against KataGo from 69.3% to 78.2%, while both baselines show no improvement. These results demonstrate that RGSC provides an effective mechanism for search control, improving both efficiency and robustness of AlphaZero training.

We apply transcoder adapters to characterize the differences between Qwen2.5-Math-7B and its reasoning-distilled variant, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B. Learned adapters are faithful to the target model's internal computation and next-token predictions. When evaluated on reasoning benchmarks, adapters match the reasoning model's response lengths and typically recover 50-90% of the accuracy gains from reasoning fine-tuning. Adapter features are sparsely activating and interpretable. When examining adapter features, we find that only ~8% have activating examples directly related to reasoning behaviors. We deeply study one such behavior -- the production of hesitation tokens (e.g., \"wait\"). Using attribution graphs, we trace hesitation to only ~2.4% of adapter features (5.6k total) performing one of two functions. These features are necessary and sufficient for producing hesitation tokens; removing them reduces response length, often without affecting accuracy. Overall, our results provide insight into reasoning training and suggest transcoder adapters may be useful for studying fine-tuning more broadly."}

To this end, we propose the Semantic-guided Adaptive Expert Forest (SAEF), a new method that organizes adapters into a structured hierarchy for better knowledge sharing. SAEF first groups tasks into conceptual clusters based on their semantic relationships. Then, within each cluster, it builds a balanced expert tree by creating new adapters from merging the adapters of similar tasks. At inference time, SAEF finds and activates a set of relevant experts from the forest for any given input. The final prediction is made by combining the outputs of these activated experts, weighted by how confident each expert is.

In this work, we investigate whether EEG captures object representations across multiple hierarchical levels, and propose episodic analysis, in which a Machine Learning (ML) model is evaluated across various, yet related, classification tasks (episodes). Unlike prior episodic EEG studies that rely on fixed or randomly sampled classes of equal cardinality, we adopt hierarchy-aware episode sampling using WordNet to generate episodes with variable classes of diverse hierarchy. We also present the largest episodic framework in the EEG domain for detecting observed text from EEG signals in the PEERS dataset, comprising $931538$ EEG samples under $1610$ object labels, acquired from $264$ human participants (subjects) performing controlled cognitive tasks, enabling the study of neural dynamics underlying perception, decision-making, and performance monitoring.\n  We examine how the semantic abstraction level affects classification performance across multiple learning techniques and architectures, providing a comprehensive analysis. The models tend to improve performance when the classification categories are drawn from higher levels of the hierarchy, suggesting sensitivity to abstraction. Our work highlights abstraction depth as an underexplored dimension of EEG decoding and motivates future research in this direction."}

The performance of these optimization routines is highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters (HPs), which are computationally expensive to tune for large-scale models. Maximal update parameterization $(μ$P$)$ is a set of scaling rules which aims to make the optimal HPs independent of the model size, thereby allowing the HPs tuned on a smaller (computationally cheaper) model to be transferred to train a larger, target model. Despite promising results for SGD and Adam, deriving $μ$P for other optimizers is challenging because the underlying tensor programming approach is difficult to grasp. Building on recent work that introduced spectral conditions as an alternative to tensor programs, we propose a novel framework to derive $μ$P for a broader class of optimizers, including AdamW, ADOPT, LAMB, Sophia, Shampoo and Muon. We implement our $μ$P derivations on multiple benchmark models and demonstrate zero-shot learning rate transfer across increasing model width for the above optimizers.

The law of robustness states that overparameterization is necessary for models to interpolate robustly; in particular, robust interpolation requires the learned function to be Lipschitz. Robust generalization asks whether small robust training loss implies small robust test loss. We resolve this problem by explicitly connecting the two for arbitrary data distributions. Specifically, we introduce a nontrivial notion of robust generalization error and convert it into a lower bound on the expected Rademacher complexity of the induced robust loss class. Our bounds recover the $Ω(n^{1/d})$ regime of Wu et al.\\ (2023) and show that, up to constants, robust generalization does not change the order of the Lipschitz constant required for smooth interpolation. We conduct experiments to probe the predicted scaling with dataset size and model capacity, testing whether empirical behavior aligns more closely with the predictions of Bubeck and Sellke (2021) or Wu et al.\\ (2023). For MNIST, we find that the lower-bound Lipschitz constant scales on the order predicted by Wu et al.\\ (2023). Informally, to obtain low robust generalization error, the Lipschitz constant must lie in a range that we bound, and the allowable perturbation radius is linked to the Lipschitz scale."}

We introduce MAST, a method that blends corrected low-fidelity observations with high-fidelity predictions, trusting high-fidelity near observed samples and relying on corrected low-fidelity elsewhere. MAST achieves this through explicit discrepancy modelling and distance-based weighting with closed-form variance propagation, producing a single heteroscedastic Gaussian process.

Most FSSL methods typically design fixed or dynamic parameter aggregation strategies to collect client knowledge on the server (external) and / or filter out low-confidence unlabeled samples to reduce mistakes in local client (internal).

We evaluate intra- and inter-node training efficiency across multiple GPU configurations on various datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, exploring the impact of distributed data parallelism on training speed, communication overhead, and overall scalability (strong and weak scaling). By systematically varying software parameters, such as batch size and gradient accumulation, we identify key factors influencing performance of distributed training. The experiments in this study provide a foundational basis for applying DeepSpeed to image-related tasks. Future work will extend these investigations to deepen our understanding of DeepSpeed's limitations and explore strategies for optimizing distributed training pipelines for Vision Transformers."}

Artifacts of the message passing paradigm in Graph Neural Networks, such as oversmoothing and oversquashing, have been attributed to these regions. However, it remains unclear how the topology of a graph interacts with the learned preferences of GNNs. Through Massive Activations, which correspond to extreme edge activation values in Graph Transformers, we probe this correspondence. Our findings on synthetic graphs and molecular benchmarks reveal that MAs do not preferentially concentrate on curvature extremes, despite their theoretical link to information flow. On the Long Range Graph Benchmark, we identify a systemic \\textit{curvature shift}: global attention mechanisms exacerbate topological bottlenecks, drastically increasing the prevalence of negative curvature. Our work reframes curvature as a diagnostic probe for understanding when and why graph learning fails."}

Ski rental was one of the first problems to be studied with predictions, where a natural prediction is simply the number of ski days. But it is both more natural and potentially more powerful to think of a prediction as a distribution p-hat over the ski days. If the true number of ski days is drawn from some true (but unknown) distribution p, then we show as our main result that there is an algorithm with expected cost at most OPT + O(min(max({eta}, 1) * sqrt(b), b log b)), where OPT is the expected cost of the optimal policy for the true distribution p, b is the cost of buying, and {eta} is the Earth Mover's (Wasserstein-1) distance between p and p-hat. Note that when {eta} < o(sqrt(b)) this gives additive loss less than b (the trivial bound), and when {eta} is arbitrarily large (corresponding to an extremely inaccurate prediction) we still do not pay more than O(b log b) additive loss. An implication of these bounds is that our algorithm has consistency O(sqrt(b)) (additive loss when the prediction error is 0) and robustness O(b log b) (additive loss when the prediction error is arbitrarily large). Moreover, we do not need to assume that we know (or have any bound on) the prediction error {eta}, in contrast with previous work in robust optimization which assumes that we know this error.\n  We complement this upper bound with a variety of lower bounds showing that it is essentially tight: not only can the consistency/robustness tradeoff not be improved, but our particular loss function cannot be meaningfully improved."}

We introduce SOM-VQ, a tokenization method that combines vector quantization with Self-Organizing Maps to learn discrete codebooks with explicit low-dimensional topology. Unlike standard VQ-VAE, SOM-VQ uses topology-aware updates that preserve neighborhood structure: nearby tokens on a learned grid correspond to semantically similar states, enabling direct geometric manipulation of the latent space. We demonstrate that SOM-VQ produces more learnable token sequences in the evaluated domains while providing an explicit navigable geometry in code space. Critically, the topological organization enables intuitive human-in-the-loop control: users can steer generation by manipulating distances in token space, achieving semantic alignment without frame-level constraints. We focus on human motion generation - a domain where kinematic structure, smooth temporal continuity, and interactive use cases (choreography, rehabilitation, HCI) make topology-aware control especially natural - demonstrating controlled divergence and convergence from reference sequences through simple grid-based sampling. SOM-VQ provides a general framework for interpretable discrete representations applicable to music, gesture, and other interactive generative domains."}

Although recent work explores various forms of reward shaping and step-level credit assignment, a key signal remains largely overlooked: the intrinsic uncertainty of LLMs. Uncertainty reflects model confidence, reveals where exploration is needed, and offers valuable learning cues even in failed trajectories. We introduce SELAUR: Self Evolving LLM Agent via Uncertainty-aware Rewards, a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates uncertainty directly into the reward design. SELAUR integrates entropy-, least-confidence-, and margin-based metrics into a combined token-level uncertainty estimate, providing dense confidence-aligned supervision, and employs a failure-aware reward reshaping mechanism that injects these uncertainty signals into step- and trajectory-level rewards to improve exploration efficiency and learning stability. Experiments on two benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, show that our method consistently improves success rates over strong baselines. Ablation studies further demonstrate how uncertainty signals enhance exploration and robustness."}

We introduce the Sequential Counterfactual Framework, which respects temporal dependencies in electronic health records by distinguishing immutable features (chronic diagnoses) from controllable features (lab values) and modeling how interventions propagate through time. Applied to 2,723 COVID-19 patients (383 Long COVID heart failure cases, 2,340 matched controls), we demonstrate that 38-67% of patients with chronic conditions would require biologically impossible counterfactuals under naive methods. We identify a cardiorenal cascade (CKD -> AKI -> HF) with relative risks of 2.27 and 1.19 at each step, illustrating temporal propagation that sequential -- but not naive -- counterfactuals can capture. Our framework transforms counterfactual explanation from \"what if this feature were different?\" to \"what if we had intervened earlier, and how would that propagate forward?\" --  yielding clinically actionable insights grounded in biological plausibility."}

However, their sampling quality plateaus with ancestral samplers as the number of steps increases. We introduce a family of Predictor-Corrector (PC) samplers for discrete diffusion that generalize prior methods and apply to arbitrary noise processes. When paired with uniform-state diffusion, our samplers outperform ancestral sampling on both language and image modeling, achieving lower generative perplexity at matched unigram entropy on OpenWebText and better FID/IS scores on CIFAR10. Crucially, unlike conventional samplers, our PC methods continue to improve with more sampling steps. Taken together, these findings call into question the assumption that Masked diffusion is the inevitable future of diffusion-based language modeling. Beyond sampling, we develop a memory-efficient curriculum for the Gaussian relaxation training phase, reducing training time by 25% and memory by 33% compared to Duo while maintaining comparable perplexity on OpenWebText and LM1B and strong downstream performance.

It defines success if any of $k$ independently sampled solutions passes a verifier. This multi-sample inference metric has motivated inference-aware fine-tuning methods that directly optimize pass@$k$. However, prior work reports a recurring trade-off: pass@k improves while pass@1 degrades under such methods. This trade-off is practically important because pass@1 often remains a hard operational constraint due to latency and cost budgets, imperfect verifier coverage, and the need for a reliable single-shot fallback. We study the origin of this trade-off and provide a theoretical characterization of when pass@k policy optimization can reduce pass@1 through gradient conflict induced by prompt interference. We show that pass@$k$ policy gradients can conflict with pass@1 gradients because pass@$k$ optimization implicitly reweights prompts toward low-success prompts; when these prompts are what we term negatively interfering, their upweighting can rotate the pass@k update direction away from the pass@1 direction. We illustrate our theoretical findings with large language model experiments on verifiable mathematical reasoning tasks."}

Kane"], "title": "Statistical Query Lower Bounds for Smoothed Agnostic Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "We study the complexity of smoothed agnostic learning, recently introduced by~\\cite{CKKMS24}, in which the learner competes with the best classifier in a target class under slight Gaussian perturbations of the inputs. Specifically, we focus on the prototypical task of agnostically learning halfspaces under subgaussian distributions in the smoothed model. The best known upper bound for this problem relies on $L_1$-polynomial regression and has complexity $d^{\\tilde{O}(1/σ^2) \\log(1/ε)}$, where $σ$ is the smoothing parameter and $ε$ is the excess error. Our main result is a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound providing formal evidence that this upper bound is close to best possible. In more detail, we show that (even for Gaussian marginals) any SQ algorithm for smoothed agnostic learning of halfspaces requires complexity $d^{Ω(1/σ^{2}+\\log(1/ε))}$. This is the first non-trivial lower bound on the complexity of this task and nearly matches the known upper bound. Roughly speaking, we show that applying $L_1$-polynomial regression to a smoothed version of the function is essentially best possible. Our techniques involve finding a moment-matching hard distribution by way of linear programming duality. This dual program corresponds exactly to finding a low-degree approximating polynomial to the smoothed version of the target function (which turns out to be the same condition required for the $L_1$-polynomial regression to work). Our explicit SQ lower bound then comes from proving lower bounds on this approximation degree for the class of halfspaces."}

The dominant approaches in this family of methods, such as Ring Attention or DeepSpeed Ulysses, enable scaling over the context dimension but do not focus on memory efficiency, which limits the sequence lengths they can support. More advanced techniques, such as Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer or activation offloading, can further extend the possible context length at the cost of training throughput. In this paper, we present UPipe, a simple yet effective context parallelism technique that performs fine-grained chunking at the attention head level. This technique significantly reduces the activation memory usage of self-attention, breaking the activation memory barrier and unlocking much longer context lengths. Our approach reduces intermediate tensor memory usage in the attention layer by as much as 87.5$\\%$ for 32B Transformers, while matching previous context parallelism techniques in terms of training speed. UPipe can support the context length of 5M tokens when training Llama3-8B on a single 8$\\times$H100 node, improving upon prior methods by over 25$\\%$."}

We also include retrospective reflection, allowing the agent to re-evaluate earlier decisions and perform model updates with hindsight for proper long-horizon credit assignment. Experiments on our newly-designed Long-Horizon Household benchmark and MuJoCo Cupboard Fitting benchmark show significant gains over baseline models, with ablative studies validating the complementary roles of reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action. Qualitative analyses, including real-robot trials, highlight behavioral correction through reflection."}

Beyond explaining previously puzzling model behaviors, this perspective yields multiple practical benefits: it enables principled architectural simplifications, admits fully parallel formulations that preserve performance while improving efficiency, and provides a systematic reduction of diverse TTT variants to a standard linear attention form. Overall, our results reframe TTT not as test-time memorization, but as learned linear attention with enhanced representational capacity."}
