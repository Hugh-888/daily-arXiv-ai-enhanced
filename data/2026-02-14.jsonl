As a consequence, it is not only a solution in General Relativity, but also in Einstein--Maxwell--dilaton theories for all coupling constants. The specific case of Entangled Relativity is noteworthy because the additional scalar degree of freedom is defined from the ratio between $R$ and $\\mathcal{L}_m$, which is ill-defined in this situation. In the present work, we embed the Mineur--Vaidya solution in a magnetic (or electric) field within the framework of Entangled Relativity, and show that the Mineur--Vaidya solution corresponds to the limit where the magnetic (respectively, electric) field vanishes. This notably allows us to demonstrate that, as in General Relativity, it is possible to dynamically form naked singularities in Entangled Relativity. This conclusion, in fact, applies to any Einstein--Maxwell--dilaton theory, although it does not seem to be widely acknowledged in the literature."}

Starting from a modified point-kinetics model with two perfectly-mixed volumes, we derive equivalent discrete-event dynamics and an Itô stochastic differential equation (SDE) system. Two solvers are implemented: an analog Monte Carlo (AMC) engine and a semi-implicit Milstein SDE solver. Transient benchmarks demonstrate perfect agreement of AMC/SDE means with deterministic solutions, while revealing that the SDE approach underestimates DNP variances in selected regimes, potentially due to the neglect of DNP noise. We further recast reactivity loss due to precursor drift in this stochastic setting and show that its estimator is negatively biased. Overall, the developed framework provides a minimal yet representative model for CFR low-population kinetics. Future work will re-derive and test SDE noise terms and apply the framework to selected transient applications such as start-up analyses of CFRs."}

But a comprehensive theoretical research on both of them remains to be performed. This work aims to investigate important algebraic properties of generalized Bell states as well as explore topological features of quantum teleportation. First, the basis theorem and basis group are introduced to explain that the extension of a generalized Bell basis by a unitary matrix is still an orthonormal basis. Then a twist operator is defined to make a connection between a generalized multiple qubit Bell state and a tensor product of two qubit Bell state. Besides them, the Temperley--Lieb algebra, the braid group relation and the Yang--Baxter equation are used to provide a topological diagrammatic description of generalized Bell states and quantum teleportation. It turns out that our approach is able to present a clear illustration of relevant quantum information protocols and exhibit a topological nature of quantum entanglement and quantum teleportation."}

Brown"], "title": "Quantum computing with anyons is fault tolerant", "comment": "7 + 11 pages, 3 + 7 figures", "summary": "In seminal work (arxiv:quant-ph/9707021) Alexei Kitaev proposed topological quantum computing (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arxiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:quant-ph/0001108, arXiv:0707.1889), whereby logic gates of a quantum computer are conducted by creating, braiding and fusing anyonic particles on a two-dimensional plane. Furthermore, he showed the proposal is inherently robust to local perturbations (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arxiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:1001.0344, arXiv:1001.4363) when anyons are created as quasiparticle excitations of a topologically ordered lattice model prepared at zero temperature. Over the decades following this proposal there have been considerable technological developments towards the construction of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Rather than maintaining some target ground state at zero temperature, a modern approach is to actively correct the errors a target state experiences, where we use noisy quantum circuit elements to identify and subsequently correct for deviations from the ideal state. We present an error-correction scheme that enables us to carry out robust universal quantum computation by braiding anyons. We show that our scheme can be carried out on a suitably large device with an arbitrarily small failure rate assuming circuit elements are below some threshold level of local noise. The error-corrected scheme we have developed therefore enables us to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation using modern quantum hardware that is now under development."}

Our algorithm achieves best-in-class efficiency for block-encoding the pre-Born-Oppenheimer molecular Hamiltonian by harnessing the linear scaling of swap networks for implementing the quadratic number of particle interactions, while using a novel alternating sign implementation of the Coulomb interaction that exploits highly optimized arithmetic routines. We benchmark our approach for a series of scientifically and industrially relevant chemical reactions. We demonstrate over an order-of-magnitude reduction in costs compared to previous state-of-the-art for the $\\rm NH_3+BF_3$ reaction, achieving a Toffoli cost of $8.7\\times10^{9}$ per femtosecond using $1362$ logical qubits (system + ancillas). Our results significantly lower the resources required for fault-tolerant simulations of photochemical reactions, while providing a suite of algorithmic primitives that are expected to serve as foundational building blocks for a broader class of quantum algorithms."}

The demon can evolve the system farther from equilibrium, on average, if the particles obey Bose-Einstein statistics than if they are distinguishable. We experimentally support this decade-and-a-half-old prediction by comparing indistinguishable with distinguishable photons. We use a fully programmable linear-optics platform, whose local photon statistics were shown recently to behave thermally. Our demon nondestructively measures the number of photons in a subset of the modes. Guided by the outcome, he conditionally interchanges the measured and unmeasured modes. This interchange creates a positive temperature difference between a mode in a particular subset and a mode in the other. The temperature difference is greater, on average, if the photons are indistinguishable. This result bolsters a long-standing prediction about the interplay among thermodynamics, information, and quantum particle statistics. Additionally, this work suggests a thermodynamic means of weakly validating boson-sampling platforms."}
