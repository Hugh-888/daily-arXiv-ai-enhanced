Within this framework,\nwe also derived analytical solutions based on scalar-tensor theory with minimal\ncoupling.\n  Our results indicate that for this configuration, the potential $U$ vanishes\nand the scalar field is phantom-like. Furthermore, an analysis of the Einstein\nequations in the Y{\\i}lmaz-Rosen metric reveals that all energy conditions are\nviolated. The corresponding energy-momentum tensor suggests the presence of\nexotic matter with negative pressure, as indicated by the negative value of\n$T_u^u$.

Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor\nTrain (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*\ntime using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,\nthis complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such\nas decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore\ntightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.\nFinally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor\nNetwork representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become\n*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains\ncomputationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important\ninsight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the\nprimary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation."}

In contrast,\nself-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates\nbetween noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the\nsolution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current\nestimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional\nnetwork randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain\niterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy\nestimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural\nnetworks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on\npretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains\nadaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it\nhighly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion\nachieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods."}

In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural\nnetworks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data\nwill typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the\nclassical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn\nredundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and\nthat redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the\ntraining error is zero."}

These pairs are\ntypically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of\ntime steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating\nheavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in\nSolution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer\ntime steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large\ntime steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset\ngeneration and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.\nSpecifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable\nsolver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps\nwith training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a \"homologous\nperturbation\" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary\nfunction, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)\nwith random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data\npoints. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the\noriginal equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and\nexperimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity.

We provide\ntheoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from\nboth statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs\ncan improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near\nthe teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs\neffectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's\ndecision boundaries more effectively than standard data.

Our main contribution is\nthe characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which\nprovides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM\nand DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional\nedge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity\ncoefficients differ.
