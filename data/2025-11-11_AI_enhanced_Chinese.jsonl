However, existing methods face three critical challenges: Inaccurate Graph Construction, caused by LLM hallucination; Poor Reasoning Ability, caused by failing to generate explicit reasons telling LLM why certain chunks were selected; and Inadequate Answering, which only partially answers the query due to the inadequate LLM reasoning, making their performance lag behind NaiveRAG on certain tasks. To address these issues, we propose AGRAG, an advanced graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework. When constructing the graph, AGRAG substitutes the widely used LLM entity extraction method with a statistics-based method, avoiding hallucination and error propagation. When retrieval, AGRAG formulates the graph reasoning procedure as the Minimum Cost Maximum Influence (MCMI) subgraph generation problem, where we try to include more nodes with high influence score, but with less involving edge cost, to make the generated reasoning paths more comprehensive. We prove this problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. The MCMI subgraph generated can serve as explicit reasoning paths to tell LLM why certain chunks were retrieved, thereby making the LLM better focus on the query-related part contents of the chunks, reducing the impact of noise, and improving AGRAG's reasoning ability. Furthermore, compared with the simple tree-structured reasoning paths, our MCMI subgraph can allow more complex graph structures, such as cycles, and improve the comprehensiveness of the generated reasoning paths.", "AI": {"tldr": "AGRAG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u907f\u514dLLM\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528MCMI\u5b50\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u521b\u5efa\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff08\u7531LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u5f15\u8d77\uff09\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff08\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff09\u3001\u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\uff08LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982NaiveRAG\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3LLM\u5b9e\u4f53\u63d0\u53d6\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\uff1b2) \u5c06\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u529b(MCMI)\u5b50\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b3) \u751f\u6210\u7684MCMI\u5b50\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u6307\u5bfcLLM\u3002", "result": "AGRAG\u907f\u514d\u4e86LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u66f4\u5168\u9762\uff08\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u73af\uff09\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5173\u6ce8\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AGRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u548cMCMI\u5b50\u56fe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u57faRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, this index is only reported annually, limiting its responsiveness to short-term fluctuations. To address this gap, the present study introduces a daily proxy for the Energy Security Index and applies it to forecast energy security at a daily frequency.The study employs a two stage approach first, a suitable daily proxy for the annual Energy Security Index is identified by applying six time series similarity measures to key energy related variables. Second, the selected proxy is modeled using the XGBoost algorithm to generate 15 day ahead forecasts, enabling high frequency monitoring of energy security dynamics.As the result of proxy choosing, Volume Brent consistently emerged as the most suitable proxy across the majority of methods. The model demonstrated strong performance, with an R squared of 0.981 on the training set and 0.945 on the test set, and acceptable error metrics . The 15 day forecast of Brent volume indicates short term fluctuations, with a peak around day 4, a decline until day 8, a rise near day 10, and a downward trend toward day 15, accompanied by prediction intervals.By integrating time series similarity measures with machine learning based forecasting, this study provides a novel framework for converting low frequency macroeconomic indicators into high frequency, actionable signals. The approach enables real time monitoring of the Energy Security Index, offering policymakers and analysts a scalable and practical tool to respond more rapidly to fast changing policy and market conditions, especially in data scarce environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u80fd\u6e90\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6570\u7684\u6bcf\u65e5\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528XGBoost\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c15\u5929\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e74\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u5bf9\u77ed\u671f\u6ce2\u52a8\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u653f\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u6e90\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6570\u4ec5\u6bcf\u5e74\u62a5\u544a\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u77ed\u671f\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u6bcf\u65e5\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528XGBoost\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c15\u5929\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5e03\u4f26\u7279\u539f\u6cb9\u4ea4\u6613\u91cf\u88ab\u9009\u4e3a\u6700\u4f73\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6R\u5e73\u65b90.981\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c60.945\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u77ed\u671f\u6ce2\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u4f4e\u9891\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6307\u6807\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9891\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

We explore extensions of these non-Riemannian approaches, aiming to replicate the observed late-time acceleration of the universe by emulating the cosmological constant's role. We also evaluate the consistency of these theories with local gravity constraints by studying their static, spherically symmetric solutions.

This task requires extensive simulations of faulty quantum circuits, which are often made tractable by considering stochastic Pauli noise models, as they are compatible with efficient classical simulation techniques. However, such noise models do not fully capture the variety of physical error mechanisms encountered in realistic quantum platforms. In this work, we extend circuit-level noise modeling beyond the Pauli framework by estimating the threshold of the color code under more general noise models. Specifically, we consider two representative non-Pauli error channels: a systematic $X$-rotation model that introduces coherent over-rotations, and an amplitude damping channel that captures relaxation processes. These models are incorporated at the circuit level into color code circuits using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz. Our simulations demonstrate that tensor network simulations enable accurate threshold estimation under non-Pauli noise for color codes up to distance $d=7$ (73 qubits).

In TAT, a short microwave or radio wave pulse is directed to the imaged target. The energy of the electromagnetic pulse is absorbed depending on the target's dielectric parameters, resulting in a spatially varying pressure distribution via the thermoacoustic effect. This pressure, known as the initial pressure distribution, relaxes as broadband ultrasound waves that are measured on the boundary of the target. In the inverse problem of TAT, the initial pressure is estimated from the measured ultrasound waves. TAT can further be extended to quantitative TAT (QTAT), where the aim is to estimate the dielectric parameters of the imaged target by utilizing a model for electromagnetic wave propagation. In this work, we consider the QTAT problem and propose an approach for simultaneous estimation of electrical conductivity and permittivity from the ultrasound waves. The problem is approached in the framework of Bayesian inverse problems. The forward model describing electromagnetic and acoustic wave propagation is based on Maxwell's equations and the acoustic wave equation, respectively. The approach is evaluated with numerical simulations. The results show that the dielectric parameters can be accurately estimated using the proposed approach.

DDM was proposed to resolve content misalignment issues in unpaired domain translation, achieving translation identifiability. However, DDM has only been implemented using GANs due to its constraints on the translation function. GANs are often unstable to train and do not provide the transport trajectory information -- yet such trajectories are useful in applications such as single-cell evolution analysis and robot route planning. This work introduces diversified flow matching (DFM), an ODE-based framework for DDM. Adapting flow matching (FM) to enforce a unified translation function as in DDM is challenging, as FM learns the translation function's velocity rather than the translation function itself. A custom bilevel optimization-based training loss, a nonlinear interpolant, and a structural reformulation are proposed to address these challenges, offering a tangible implementation. To our knowledge, DFM is the first ODE-based approach guaranteeing translation identifiability.

However, implementing scalable quantum nodes with high-fidelity optical readout of the electron spin state requires efficient photon emission and collection from the system. In this manuscript, we report a quantum photonic interface for SnV- centers based on one-dimensional photonic crystal cavities fabricated in diamond thin films. Furthermore, we develop a model describing the spontaneous emission dynamics of our system, allowing for rigorous determination of Purcell factors and the C/D branching ratio from cavity enhancement of the C and D transitions of the SnV- zero phonon line. We observe quality factors up to ~6000 across this sample, and measure up to a 12-fold lifetime reduction. By considering the lifetime reduction of both the C and D transitions independently, we determine the C/D branching ratio to be \u03b7BR=0.7815, in line with previous theoretical and experimental findings.

Unfortunately, the applications of a QMC simulation are limited because extracting dynamic properties requires solving the analytic continuation (AC) problem. Across the many fields that use QMC methods, there is no universally accepted analytic continuation algorithm for extracting dynamic properties, but many publications compare to the maximum entropy method. We investigate when entropy maximization is an acceptable approach. We show that stochastic sampling algorithms reduce to entropy maximization when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We investigate when is Bryan's controversial optimization algorithm [Bryan, Eur. Biophys.

We show that Bryan's algorithm is appropriate when the noise is near zero or when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We also investigate the mean squared error, finding a better scaling when the Bayesian prior is near the true solution than when the noise is near zero. We point to examples of improved data-driven Bayesian priors that have already leveraged this advantage.

In this work, we introduce Iterative Reward-Guided Refinement (IterRef), a novel test-time scaling method tailored to discrete diffusion that leverages reward-guided noising-denoising transitions to progressively refine misaligned intermediate states. We formalize this process within a Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) framework, proving convergence to the reward-aligned distribution. Unlike prior methods that assume the current state is already aligned with the reward distribution and only guide the subsequent transition, our approach explicitly refines each state in situ, progressively steering it toward the optimal intermediate distribution. Across both text and image domains, we evaluate IterRef on diverse discrete diffusion models and observe consistent improvements in reward-guided generation quality.

We show that such correlations can significantly influence the dynamics of multipartite entanglement, in some cases slowing its decay and, under ideal conditions, even enabling full preservation. Using tripartite negativity as an entanglement measure, we derive analytical results for the GHZ and W states, demonstrating their contrasting responses to correlated and anticorrelated noise. Our analysis identifies regimes in which multipartite entanglement can be sustained despite environmental interactions, offering new insight into how noise correlations may serve as a resource for protecting quantum coherence in multi-qubit systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e09\u7ea0\u7f20\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5728\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8c03\u7edf\u8ba1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u7ea0\u7f20\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u51cf\u7f13\u5176\u8870\u51cf\u751a\u81f3\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63a8\u8fdb\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u566a\u58f0\u6e90\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u534a\u7ecf\u5178\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ea0\u7f20\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u66b4\u9732\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8c03\u7edf\u8ba1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u65b9\u8d1f\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ea0\u7f20\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5bf9GHZ\u6001\u548cW\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u51cf\u7f13\u7ea0\u7f20\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751a\u81f3\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002GHZ\u6001\u548cW\u6001\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u548c\u53cd\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5728\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u591a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, standard spectral methods based on Fourier transforms struggle with problems involving discontinuous coefficients due to the Gibbs phenomenon and poor representation of sharp interfaces. We introduce the Walsh-Hadamard Neural Operator (WHNO), which leverages Walsh-Hadamard transforms-a spectral basis of rectangular wave functions naturally suited for piecewise constant fields-combined with learnable spectral weights that transform low-sequency Walsh coefficients to capture global dependencies efficiently. We validate WHNO on three problems: steady-state Darcy flow (preliminary validation), heat conduction with discontinuous thermal conductivity, and the 2D Burgers equation with discontinuous initial conditions. In controlled comparisons with Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) under identical conditions, WHNO demonstrates superior accuracy with better preservation of sharp solution features at material interfaces. Critically, we discover that weighted ensemble combinations of WHNO and FNO achieve substantial improvements over either model alone: for both heat conduction and Burgers equation, optimal ensembles reduce mean squared error by 35-40 percent and maximum error by up to 25 percent compared to individual models. This demonstrates that Walsh-Hadamard and Fourier representations capture complementary aspects of discontinuous PDE solutions, with WHNO excelling at sharp interfaces while FNO captures smooth features effectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Walsh-Hadamard\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50(WHNO)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u77e9\u5f62\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u8c31\u57fa\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u7cfb\u6570PDE\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0eFourier\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50(FNO)\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u6210\u52a0\u6743\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u548cBurgers\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e35-40%\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u4e8eFourier\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u7cfb\u6570PDE\u65f6\u5b58\u5728Gibbs\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u5c16\u9510\u754c\u9762\u8868\u793a\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5904\u7406\u5206\u6bb5\u5e38\u6570\u573a\u7684\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Walsh-Hadamard\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u77e9\u5f62\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u8c31\u57fa\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u8c31\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4e\u9891Walsh\u7cfb\u6570\u8f6c\u6362\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eFNO\u5f62\u6210\u52a0\u6743\u96c6\u6210\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7a33\u6001Darcy\u6d41\u3001\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u548c\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u76842D Burgers\u65b9\u7a0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff0cWHNO\u6bd4FNO\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u4fdd\u6301\u6750\u6599\u754c\u9762\u5904\u7684\u5c16\u9510\u7279\u5f81\u3002WHNO\u4e0eFNO\u52a0\u6743\u96c6\u6210\u7ec4\u5408\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e35-40%\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe25%\u3002", "conclusion": "Walsh-Hadamard\u548cFourier\u8868\u793a\u6355\u83b7\u4e86\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eedPDE\u89e3\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u65b9\u9762\uff1aWHNO\u64c5\u957f\u5904\u7406\u5c16\u9510\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u800cFNO\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u5e73\u6ed1\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Prevailing heuristics, such as confidence based sampling, are myopic: they optimize locally, fail to leverage extra test-time compute, and let early decoding mistakes cascade. We propose Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path selection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external reward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by sampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to subsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking measurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to avoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six benchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate consistent performance improvements. LookUM requires only two to three paths to achieve peak performance, demonstrating remarkably efficient path selection. The consistent improvements on both LLaDA and post-trained LLaDA 1.5 are particularly striking: base LLaDA with LookUM rivals the performance of RL-tuned LLaDA 1.5, while LookUM further enhances LLaDA 1.5 itself showing that uncertainty based verification provides orthogonal benefits to reinforcement learning and underscoring the versatility of our framework.

We construct a specific exponential $f(Q)$ model as $f(Q) = Q + \u03b7_1 Q_0\\left(1 - e^{-\u03b7_2 \\sqrt{Q/Q_0}}\\right)$, designed to smoothly deviate from General Relativity and accommodate both early-time inflation and late-time accelerated expansion. By employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, we constrain the model parameters $\u03b7_1$, $\u03b7_2$, $H_0$, and $\u03a9_{m_0}$ using a combination of cosmic chronometers (CC), Pantheon, and Pantheon$^+$ Supernovae datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that the model consistently supports a late-time acceleration scenario and is in good agreement with current cosmological observations. We extensively analyze the dynamical behavior of the model using key cosmological diagnostics, including the deceleration parameter, equation of state, energy density parameters, Statefinder, and Om diagnostics. The reconstructed Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and distance modulus $\u03bc(z)$ show strong consistency with $\u039b$CDM and observational data, while subtle deviations at higher redshifts highlight the value of multi-probe observations. In addition, the examination of energy conditions shows that, in accordance with cosmic acceleration, the Strong Energy Condition (SEC) is broken at lower redshifts while the Dominant Energy Condition (DEC) and Null Energy Condition (NEC) are satisfied. Cosmic age estimates from the model are consistently in agreement with Planck constraints. Our results indicate the viability of exponential $f(Q)$ gravity. A comparative statistical analysis reveals that while $\u039b$CDM remains statistically preferred based on AIC and BIC criteria, the exponential $f(Q)$ model yields comparable fits and remains a theoretically motivated and viable alternative for describing cosmic acceleration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u8fdc\u5e73\u884c\u5f15\u529b\u5728\u4fee\u6b63f(Q)\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6307\u6570f(Q)\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u6ed1\u504f\u79bb\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5e76\u5bb9\u7eb3\u65e9\u671f\u66b4\u80c0\u548c\u665a\u671f\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22f(Q)\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b87\u5b99\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e2\u80fd\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u65e9\u671f\u66b4\u80c0\u548c\u665a\u671f\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6307\u6570f(Q)\u6a21\u578bf(Q)=Q+\u03b7\u2081Q\u2080(1-e^{-\u03b7\u2082\u221a(Q/Q\u2080)})\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u5b87\u5b99\u8ba1\u65f6\u5668\u3001Pantheon\u548cPantheon\u207a\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u901f\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u652f\u6301\u665a\u671f\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u543b\u5408\u826f\u597d\u3002\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u54c8\u52c3\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u6a21\u6570\u4e0e\u039bCDM\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u5904\u5b58\u5728\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5f3a\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u5728\u4f4e\u7ea2\u79fb\u5904\u88ab\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u800c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u96f6\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u5f97\u5230\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u6570f(Q)\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u039bCDM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u66f4\u53d7\u9752\u7750\uff0c\u4f46\u6307\u6570f(Q)\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u62df\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u662f\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b87\u5b99\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The generation and manipulation of biphoton entanglement in topologically distinct modes paves the way in this direction. Here we present a comprehensive method for regulating the topological properties of the system by combining the nonlinearity in waveguides, i.e., nonlinearity in the waveguide coupling materials, and the waveguide lattice structure. Our method enables the generation of topological biphoton states with injected pump activation on the topologically trivial modes. This is realized through self-induced manipulation on pump-dependent nonlinear couplings on the defects, which is unable to be realized while there are no such nonlinear couplings. Specifically, by including the nonlinear gain/loss mechanism in the coupling between the nearest-neighbor waveguides and the third-order Kerr nonlinearity effect along the waveguides, the injected pump power will be the controllable parameter for the manipulation of the topology in the defect states and the generation of biphoton entanglement states. We also present an experimental proposal to realize our scheme and its generalization in the contemporaneous \"active\" topological photonics time-bin platforms. Our method can be used in other Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models with various defect configurations. Our method enables the reusability and versatility of SSH lattice chips and their application for fault-tolerant quantum information processing, promoting the industrialization process of quantum technology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce2\u5bfc\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\u548c\u6676\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u8c03\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u5e73\u51e1\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u6cf5\u6d66\u6fc0\u6d3b\u751f\u6210\u62d3\u6251\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u6001\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u548c\u64cd\u63a7\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce2\u5bfc\u8026\u5408\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\u548c\u6ce2\u5bfc\u6676\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6cf5\u6d66\u529f\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u8c03\u63a7\u7f3a\u9677\u6001\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u6ce2\u5bfc\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u76ca/\u635f\u8017\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u9636Kerr\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u5e73\u51e1\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u6cf5\u6d66\u6fc0\u6d3b\u751f\u6210\u62d3\u6251\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8026\u5408\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5177\u6709\u5404\u79cd\u7f3a\u9677\u914d\u7f6e\u7684SSH\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86SSH\u6676\u683c\u82af\u7247\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u548c\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4ea7\u4e1a\u5316\u8fdb\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Each hood is numerically modeled with a coupled Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)-Finite Element Analysis (FEA), using 1.2M cells in total to ensure spatial and temporal accuracy. The dataset provides time-resolved physical fields, along with STL meshes and structured natural language prompts for text-to-geometry synthesis. Existing datasets are either confined to 2D cases, exhibit limited geometric variations, or lack the multi-modal annotations and data structures - shortcomings we address with AutoHood3D. We validate our numerical methodology, establish quantitative baselines across five neural architectures, and demonstrate systematic surrogate errors in displacement and force predictions. These findings motivate the design of novel approaches and multiphysics loss functions that enforce fluid-solid coupling during model training.

Ibrahim"], "title": "Adaptive Sample-Level Framework Motivated by Distributionally Robust Optimization with Variance-Based Radius Assignment for Enhanced Neural Network Generalization Under Distribution Shift", "comment": "Conference", "summary": "Distribution shifts and minority subpopulations frequently undermine the reliability of deep neural networks trained using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this by optimizing for the worst-case risk within a neighborhood of the training distribution. However, conventional methods depend on a single, global robustness budget, which can lead to overly conservative models or a misallocation of robustness. We propose a variance-driven, adaptive, sample-level DRO (Var-DRO) framework that automatically identifies high-risk training samples and assigns a personalized robustness budget to each based on its online loss variance. Our formulation employs two-sided, KL-divergence-style bounds to constrain the ratio between adversarial and empirical weights for every sample. This results in a linear inner maximization problem over a convex polytope, which admits an efficient water-filling solution. To stabilize training, we introduce a warmup phase and a linear ramp schedule for the global cap on per-sample budgets, complemented by label smoothing for numerical robustness. Evaluated on CIFAR-10-C (corruptions), our method achieves the highest overall mean accuracy compared to ERM and KL-DRO. On Waterbirds, Var-DRO improves overall performance while matching or surpassing KL-DRO.

We find that the Interacting model predicts a Hubble constant of $h = 0.659 \\pm 0.0063$, deviating from the $\u039b$CDM value by approximately $2.93\u03c3$, while the Non-Interacting model shows a $3.78\u03c3$ deviation. The positive coupling parameter (\\( \u03b3> 0 \\)) further suggests a transfer of energy from dark matter to dark energy. According to the Jeffreys scale, the Interacting model shows moderate evidence against the $\u039b$CDM model, whereas the Non-Interacting model shows only inconclusive evidence. Further, we investigate both models through the lens of dynamical systems analysis. We formulate the cosmological evolution equations with a phenomenological interaction term and recast them into an autonomous system to study the qualitative behavior of cosmic expansion. Critical points of the system are identified and analyzed to study the corresponding cosmological dynamics. In the interacting model, we obtained five critical points, whereas in the non-interacting scenario, four distinct sets of critical points were identified. The obtained critical points, governed by cosmological parameters, represent distinct cosmic epochs, commencing from the early time stiff matter domination to late-time acceleration. Their stability is examined through linear stability analysis under appropriate physical constraints. The evolution of background cosmological parameters are also examined in terms of the dynamical system variable, and the obtained values align with observational results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6307\u6570\u52bf\u548c\u6697\u533a\u8026\u5408\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DESI DR2\u3001Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u548c\u538b\u7f29CMB\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u6d4b\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u54c8\u52c3\u5e38\u6570\u4e0e\u039bCDM\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u91cf\u4ece\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5411\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0e\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u54c8\u52c3\u5e38\u6570\u5f20\u529b\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528DESI DR2\u91cd\u5b50\u58f0\u5b66\u632f\u8361\u3001Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u548c\u538b\u7f29CMB\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9879\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u6cbb\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4bh=0.659\u00b10.0063\uff0c\u4e0e\u039bCDM\u504f\u5dee2.93\u03c3\uff1b\u975e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee3.78\u03c3\u3002\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u03b3>0\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u91cf\u4ece\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5411\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u4e865\u4e2a\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\uff08\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff09\u548c4\u4e2a\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\uff08\u975e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5b87\u5b99\u65f6\u671f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u039bCDM\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e2d\u7b49\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u65e9\u671f\u521a\u6027\u7269\u8d28\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5230\u665a\u671f\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

Building on prior initiatives such as XAI-BENCH, FastML Science Benchmarks, PDEBench, and the SciMLBench framework, our effort consolidates a large set of disparate benchmarks and frameworks into a single taxonomy of scientific, application, and system-level benchmarks. New benchmarks can be added through an open submission workflow coordinated by the MLCommons Science Working Group and evaluated against a six-category rating rubric that promotes and identifies high-quality benchmarks, enabling stakeholders to select benchmarks that meet their specific needs. The architecture is extensible, supporting future scientific and AI/ML motifs, and we discuss methods for identifying emerging computing patterns for unique scientific workloads.

Our analysis compares the predictive capabilities of traditional time series models, Prophet, LSTM sequence-to-sequence neural networks, and hybrid models. A key challenge in developing these models is the required forecasting horizon, as fuel demand needs to be predicted for the next 30 days to optimize sourcing strategies. To ensure the reliability of the data-driven approaches and provide valuable insights to practitioners, we analyze three different datasets. The primary objective of this study is to present a comprehensive case study on jet fuel demand forecasting, demonstrating the advantages of employing data-driven models and highlighting the impact of incorporating additional variables in the predictive models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u71c3\u6cb9\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u3001Prophet\u3001LSTM\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e39\u9ea6\u4e3b\u8981\u822a\u7a7a\u71c3\u6cb9\u5206\u9500\u5546\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u822a\u7a7a\u71c3\u6cb9\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u822a\u7a7a\u5e02\u573a\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u8fd0\u8425\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u884c\u4e1a\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u4e39\u9ea6\u4e3b\u8981\u822a\u7a7a\u71c3\u6cb9\u5206\u9500\u5546\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u3001Prophet\u3001LSTM\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u89e3\u51b330\u5929\u9884\u6d4b\u671f\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u71c3\u6cb9\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7eb3\u5165\u989d\u5916\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u71c3\u6cb9\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Even if it is known that a smooth event horizon (in the sense of Penrose, Hawking and Ellis) is a null hypersurface and has the above semi-permeability property, at the best of our knowledge, it was not known so far that the latter is a mere consequence of the former. Our result leads to the concepts of barriers (= null hypersurfaces separating the space-time into disjoint regions) and black regions (= time-oriented regions bounded by barriers). These objects naturally include (smooth) event horizons and (smoothly bounded) black holes.

We obtained the inner shadow, redshift characteristics, and intensity distribution of thin-disk images of the KTN black hole, as observed by a common observer located at different positions. The results show that increasing the spin parameter progressively deforms the critical curve into a \"D\" shape while simultaneously shrinking and distorting the inner shadow. More importantly, for n = 0.3 at theta_o = 80 degrees, the inner shadow develops a novel \"duck-cap-like\" morphology with a sharply protruding lower-right edge beyond the critical curve. We term this feature the \"extended inner shadow\", a structure distinct from the Kerr case. Unlike the standard inner shadow, it consists partly of photons absorbed by the horizon and partly of photons that avoid both absorption and crossing the disk plane, thus receiving no emission. Such deviations from Kerr predictions could be tested by future high-precision astronomical observations, potentially offering new evidence for the existence of NUT charge (or the gravitomagnetic monopole) in black holes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u53cd\u5411\u5149\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7814\u7a76Kerr-Taub-NUT\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u8584\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7167\u5c04\u4e0b\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0eKerr\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5185\u9634\u5f71\u7ed3\u6784\u2014\u2014\"\u9e2d\u820c\u5e3d\u72b6\"\u5ef6\u4f38\u5185\u9634\u5f71\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Kerr-Taub-NUT\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22NUT\u8377\uff08\u6216\u5f15\u529b\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5929\u6587\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u503c\u53cd\u5411\u5149\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u8584\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7167\u5c04\u4e0b\u7684Kerr-Taub-NUT\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u6d4b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5185\u9634\u5f71\u3001\u7ea2\u79fb\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u5927\u4f1a\u4f7f\u4e34\u754c\u66f2\u7ebf\u53d8\u5f62\u4e3a\"D\"\u5f62\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7f29\u5c0f\u548c\u626d\u66f2\u5185\u9634\u5f71\u3002\u5f53n=0.3\u3001theta_o=80\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u5185\u9634\u5f71\u51fa\u73b0\u65b0\u578b\"\u9e2d\u820c\u5e3d\u72b6\"\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u5176\u53f3\u4e0b\u8fb9\u7f18\u5c16\u9510\u7a81\u51fa\u8d85\u51fa\u4e34\u754c\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\"\u5ef6\u4f38\u5185\u9634\u5f71\"\u3002", "conclusion": "Kerr-Taub-NUT\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0eKerr\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u79bb\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5929\u6587\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9bNUT\u8377\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u65b0\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

However, two key challenges remain: (i) the need for accurate estimation of traffic quality together with sufficiently high confidence in the model's predictions, typically addressed through uncertainty modeling, and (ii) the efficiency bottlenecks that such uncertainty modeling introduces in real-time applications due to repeated inference. To address these challenges, we propose DAUM, a joint modeling framework that integrates multi-objective learning with uncertainty modeling, yielding both traffic quality predictions and reliable confidence estimates. Building on DAUM, we further apply knowledge distillation to reduce the computational overhead of uncertainty modeling, while largely preserving predictive accuracy and retaining the benefits of uncertainty estimation. Experiments on the JD advertisement dataset demonstrate that DAUM consistently improves predictive performance, with the distilled model delivering a tenfold increase in inference speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DAUM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ade\u4ef7\u62e6\u622a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea610\u500d", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ade\u4ef7\u62e6\u622a\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6d41\u91cf\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAUM\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500", "result": "\u5728JD\u5e7f\u544a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDAUM\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea610\u500d\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "DAUM\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ade\u4ef7\u62e6\u622a\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Within the symmetric teleparallel framework, a representative $f(Q)$ model is constructed, and the corresponding background cosmological equations are derived. The analysis aims to test whether this geometric formulation yields more consistent realizations of nonminimal matter-geometry couplings. A comprehensive statistical MCMC analysis is performed using cosmic chronometers, DESI BAO DR2, and Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+, DESY5, and Union3 samples. To complement the statistical study, we employ machine learning methods, such as linear regression, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest algorithms, to evaluate the predictive performance and robustness of the data. The results indicate that a partial alleviation of the $H_0$ tension can be achieved for a broad range of parameter choices.

Deep neural kernels provide a principled framework to interpret over-parameterized neural networks by mapping hierarchical feature transformations into kernel spaces, thereby combining the expressive power of deep architectures with the analytical tractability of kernel methods. Recent advances, particularly neural tangent kernels (NTKs) derived by gradient inner products, have established connections between infinitely wide neural networks and nonparametric Bayesian inference. However, the existing NTK paradigm has been predominantly confined to the infinite-width regime, while overlooking the representational role of network depth. To address this gap, we propose a depth-induced NTK kernel based on a shortcut-related architecture, which converges to a Gaussian process as the network depth approaches infinity. We theoretically analyze the training invariance and spectrum properties of the proposed kernel, which stabilizes the kernel dynamics and mitigates degeneration. Experimental results further underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our findings significantly extend the existing landscape of the neural kernel theory and provide an in-depth understanding of deep learning and the scaling law.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6377\u5f84\u8fde\u63a5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838\uff0c\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8be5\u6838\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u8c31\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6377\u5f84\u8fde\u63a5\u67b6\u6784\u6784\u5efa\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8be5\u6838\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u8c31\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bf1\u5bfcNTK\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u6838\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u683c\u5c40\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

These perturbations subsequently source second-order gravitational waves with peak amplitudes governed by the phase transition parameter \\(\u03b2/H_*\\) and decay rate $\u0393$.\n  We apply this mechanism in the reheating scanario where the decay rate of inflaton are modulated by the scalar field that undergoes a first-order phase transition.\n  Numerical calculations reveal that the gravitational wave energy spectrum typically reaches \\(\u03a9_{\\text{GW}} \\sim 10^{-10}\\), demonstrating prospects for detection by space-based interferometers like LISA, TianQin and Taiji.\n  This work establishes a new approach to probe phase transition processes in the early Universe without requiring significant vacuum energy release.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4e00\u9636\u76f8\u53d8\u8c03\u8282\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u8870\u53d8\u7387\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u3002\u6c14\u6ce1\u6210\u6838\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u53d8\u5f02\u6b65\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8870\u53d8\u7387\u0393\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u4ea7\u751f\u8d85\u89c6\u754c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e8c\u9636\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u8457\u771f\u7a7a\u80fd\u91cf\u91ca\u653e\u5c31\u80fd\u63a2\u6d4b\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u76f8\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u76f8\u53d8\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u518d\u52a0\u70ed\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5386\u4e00\u9636\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u8c03\u8282\u66b4\u80c0\u5b50\u7684\u8870\u53d8\u7387\u3002\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80fd\u8c31\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u663e\u793a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80fd\u8c31\u901a\u5e38\u8fbe\u5230\u03a9_GW \u223c 10^{-10}\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u88abLISA\u3001\u5929\u7434\u548c\u592a\u6781\u7b49\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u63a2\u6d4b\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u76f8\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u8457\u771f\u7a7a\u80fd\u91cf\u91ca\u653e\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Perfect correction of these Gaussian lossy channels with Gaussian operations alone is known to be impossible. In this work, we investigate the Petz recovery map as an approximate recovery. We construct the Petz recovery of single mode losses and its implementations. In particular, we show that the recovery performance of Petz recovery map is better than the recovery protocol that replaces the noisy state with the belief state.

However, if the equation does not meet the user's expectations, there are few options for getting other equation suggestions without intensive work with the system. To fill this gap, we propose Residuals for Equation Discovery (RED), a post-processing method that improves a given equation in a targeted manner, based on its residuals. By parsing the initial equation to a syntax tree, we can use node-based calculation rules to compute the residual for each subequation of the initial equation. It is then possible to use this residual as new target variable in the original data set and generate a new prompt. If, with the new prompt, the equation discovery system suggests a subequation better than the old subequation on a validation set, we replace the latter by the former. RED is usable with any equation discovery system, is fast to calculate, and is easy to extend for new mathematical operations.

Our quantum speed limits provide lower bounds on how fast a physical system evolves to attain or lose certain imaginarity, with potential applications in efficient quantum computation designs, quantum control and quantum sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u865a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u3001\u8ff9\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u865a\u5ea6\u7b49\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u8017\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53d8\u6362\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u865a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u3001\u8ff9\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u865a\u5ea6\u7b49\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u865a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u8017\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u968f\u673a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53d8\u6362\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u865a\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u5230\u83b7\u5f97\u6216\u5931\u53bb\u7279\u5b9a\u865a\u5ea6\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u5230\u83b7\u5f97\u6216\u5931\u53bb\u7279\u5b9a\u865a\u5ea6\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Most existing RL systems for LLMs operate in a fully synchronous manner, where training must wait for the rollout of an entire batch to complete. This design leads to severe inefficiencies, as extremely long trajectories can stall the entire rollout process and leave many GPUs idle. To address this issue, we propose Concurrency- Controlled Partial Rollout with Importance Sampling (CoPRIS), which mitigates long-tail inefficiencies by maintaining a fixed number of concurrent rollouts, early-terminating once sufficient samples are collected, and reusing unfinished trajectories in subsequent rollouts. To mitigate the impact of off-policy trajectories, we introduce Cross-stage Importance Sampling Correction, which concatenates buffered log probabilities from the previous policy with those recomputed under the current policy for importance sampling correction. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CoPRIS achieves up to 1.94x faster training while maintaining comparable or superior performance to synchronous RL systems.

Deviations from the Kerr geometry are parameterized by replacing the horizon's absorbing boundary with a reflective surface at a fractional distance epsilon. This modification produces long-lived monochromatic quasinormal modes that can be probed through extended integration times. Building on previous work that set a bound of log10(epsilon) = -23.5 for GW150914, we reproduce and validate those results and extend the analysis to additional events from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs. By combining posterior samples from multiple detections, we construct a joint posterior yielding a tightened 90 percent upper bound of log10(epsilon) < -27.12, demonstrating the statistical power of population-level inference through cumulative evidence. Finally, analyzing the newly observed high signal-to-noise ratio event GW250114 from the O4b run, we obtain the most stringent single-event constraint to date, log10(epsilon) < -29.58 (90 percent credible region).

However, FL suffers from significant communication overhead due to the frequent exchange of high-dimensional model updates over constrained networks. In this paper, we present FedSparQ, a lightweight compression framework that dynamically sparsifies the gradient of each client through an adaptive threshold, applies half-precision quantization to retained entries and integrates residuals from error feedback to prevent loss of information. FedSparQ requires no manual tuning of sparsity rates or quantization schedules, adapts seamlessly to both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions, and is agnostic to model architecture. Through extensive empirical evaluation on vision benchmarks under independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data, we show that FedSparQ substantially reduces communication overhead (reducing by 90% of bytes sent compared to FedAvg) while preserving or improving model accuracy (improving by 6% compared to FedAvg non-compressed solution or to state-of-the-art compression models) and enhancing convergence robustness (by 50%, compared to the other baselines). Our approach provides a practical, easy-to-deploy solution for bandwidth-constrained federated deployments and lays the groundwork for future extensions in adaptive precision and privacy-preserving protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedSparQ\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u3001\u534a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u51cf\u5c1190%\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u663e\u8457\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u4ea4\u6362\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9608\u503c\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u6761\u76ee\u5e94\u7528\u534a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u8bef\u5dee\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u7a00\u758f\u7387\u6216\u91cf\u5316\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5728IID\u548c\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4FedAvg\u51cf\u5c1190%\u901a\u4fe1\u5b57\u8282\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad86%\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u534750%\u3002", "conclusion": "FedSparQ\u4e3a\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6613\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u672a\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This beats the scaling law of Brownian motion. In this article we investigate sources of gravitational waves in the early universe as well as in astrophysical settings. Cosmological sources may include primordial black holes or other sources immediately after the Big Bang when there were pockets of hot material, and large density fluctuations. Gravitational waves from mergers of primordial black holes produce memory. We show that due to the conditions in which these are taking place the gravitational wave memory will be increasing in time following a certain power law. Corresponding results hold for any gravitational wave memory from a cosmological source where the surrounding conditions are similar. The stochastic limit of these memories is a stochastic process growing in time faster than the $\\sqrt{t}$ scaling law of Brownian motion. The latter is also typical for noise and for the limit of memory events as they have been mostly considered in the literature. In an expanding universe, the memory is enhanced by the expansion itself. Our results provide a tool to extract gravitational wave sources of this type from data using this memory signature. This would be particularly useful for the PTA data that has been already observed, answering the long-standing question on how to extract memory signals from the data.

However, existing GFMs struggle with unstable few-shot fine-tuning, where both performance and adaptation efficiency exhibit significant fluctuations caused by the randomness in the support sample selection and structural discrepancies between the pre-trained and target graphs. How to fine-tune GFMs robustly and efficiently to enable trustworthy knowledge transfer across domains and tasks is the major challenge. In this paper, we propose GRAVER, a novel Generative gRAph VocabulariEs for Robust GFM fine-tuning framework that tackles the aforementioned instability via generative augmentations. Specifically, to identify transferable units, we analyze and extract key class-specific subgraph patterns by ego-graph disentanglement and validate their transferability both theoretically and empirically. To enable effective pre-training across diverse domains, we leverage a universal task template based on ego-graph similarity and construct graph vocabularies via graphon-based generative experts. To facilitate robust and efficient prompt fine-tuning, we grave the support samples with in-context vocabularies, where the lightweight MoE-CoE network attentively routes knowledge from source domains.

The methods are shown to be equivalent when the condition $M'' S' - S'' M' \\neq 0$ holds, while deviations appear when this relation fails, signaling subtle connections between mass $M(r_h)$, entropy $S(r_h)$, and topological structure, with $r_h$ being the horizon radius. We first verify this equivalence to Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, recovering known classifications and confirming the consistency of our approach with respect to the validity of the above condition. We then extend the analysis to four-dimensional black strings, regarded as cylindrically symmetric black hole solutions in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Our results show that both neutral and charged black strings possess the same global topological number, $W = +1$, implying that electric charge does not influence their topological classification.

Respectively, we analyse permutational computing transition amplitudes, evaluate barren plateaus for SU(2) symmetric ans\u00e4tze, study properties of AKLT states, and derive the minimum quantised volume in loop quantum gravity.\n  Our starting point is the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus, a purely diagrammatic language that has been proven to be complete for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. That is, any equation that can be derived in the Hilbert space formalism, can also be derived in the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus. We embed the Spin-ZX calculus inside the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus, rendering it a quantum information flavoured diagrammatic language for the quantum theory of angular momentum, i.e. SU(2) representation theory. We diagrammatically derive the fundamental spin coupling objects - such as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, symmetrising mappings between qubits and spin spaces, and spin Hamiltonians - under this embedding.\n  Our results establish the Spin-ZX calculus as a powerful tool for representing and computing with SU(2) systems graphically, offering new insights into foundational relationships and paving the way for new diagrammatic algorithms for theoretical physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Spin-ZX\u6f14\u7b97\u662fPenrose\u56fe\u548cbinor\u6f14\u7b97\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3aSU(2)\u8868\u793a\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u56fe\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u7269\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06Penrose\u56fe\u548cbinor\u6f14\u7b97\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u56fe\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4e3aSU(2)\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u7ef4ZX\u6f14\u7b97\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165Spin-ZX\u6f14\u7b97\uff0c\u56fe\u63a8\u5bfc\u81ea\u65cb\u8026\u5408\u57fa\u672c\u5bf9\u8c61\uff08\u5982Clebsch-Gordan\u7cfb\u6570\u3001\u5bf9\u79f0\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u81ea\u65cb\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff1a\u5206\u6790\u7f6e\u6362\u8ba1\u7b97\u8dc3\u8fc1\u5e45\u5ea6\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30SU(2)\u5bf9\u79f0ans\u00e4tze\u7684\u8d2b\u7620\u9ad8\u539f\u3001\u7814\u7a76AKLT\u6001\u6027\u8d28\u3001\u63a8\u5bfc\u5708\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u4f53\u79ef\u3002", "conclusion": "Spin-ZX\u6f14\u7b97\u6210\u4e3aSU(2)\u7cfb\u7edf\u56fe\u5f62\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u65b0\u56fe\u7b97\u6cd5\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

The model also gives subtly different predictions to quantum mechanics, that could be tested experimentally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u8fdd\u53cd\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d85\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u673a\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\u4e0d\u5bf9\u6613\u7684\u7b97\u7b26\u65f6\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8fdd\u53cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8fdd\u53cd\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7ed9\u51fa\u5fae\u5999\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u8d85\u51b3\u5b9a\u8bba\u6216\u9006\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdd\u53cd\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u57fa\u7840\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework that integrates advanced soft computing techniques - Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), Denoising Autoencoder (DAE), Graph Neural Network (GNN), and Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) - to address the multidimensional challenges of predictive maintenance in complex manufacturing systems. Specifically, the proposed framework innovatively combines the powerful frequency-domain representation capability of FNOs to capture high-dimensional temporal patterns; DAEs to achieve robust, noise-resistant latent state embedding from complex non-Gaussian sensor data; and GNNs to accurately represent inter-device dependencies for coordinated system-wide maintenance decisions. Furthermore, by exploiting PPO, the framework ensures stable and efficient optimisation of long-term maintenance strategies to effectively handle uncertainty and non-stationary dynamics. Experimental validation demonstrates that the approach significantly outperforms multiple deep learning baseline models with up to 13% cost reduction, as well as strong convergence and inter-module synergy.

The inherently nonlinear nature of the FFE equations makes finding exact solutions a challenging task. This paper explores an innovative approach to solving these equations by foliating spacetime into two-dimensional surfaces, specifically tailored to the geometry of electromagnetic fields. The foliation approach exploits the fact that the kernel of the force-free field defines an involutive distribution, naturally lending itself to a geometric decomposition. This method has previously been applied with great success in Kerr and FLRW spacetimes. By extending this formalism, we develop new exact solutions to the FFE equations in several distinct spacetimes, including cases where the metric remains partially undetermined. Additionally, we present a novel class of solutions that smoothly transition between magnetically dominated and electrically dominated regimes over time. Finally, we construct a pair of vacuum degenerate fields in arbitrary axisymmetric spacetimes, further demonstrating the utility of the foliation approach. These results offer a new perspective on the dynamical evolution of electromagnetic fields and their geometric underpinnings in various spacetime geometries, broadening the applicability of the framework for understanding the dynamics of highly magnetized plasmas in general relativistic astrophysical contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u53f6\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u529b\u81ea\u7531\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u78c1\u7535\u4e3b\u5bfc\u72b6\u6001\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u7684\u89e3\u548c\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u7a7a\u9000\u5316\u573a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u78c1\u5316\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u529b\u81ea\u7531\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u662f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7b49\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u5bfb\u627e\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u53f6\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u66f2\u9762\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u529b\u81ea\u7531\u573a\u7684\u6838\u5b9a\u4e49\u53ef\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5728Kerr\u548cFLRW\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684FFE\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5ea6\u91cf\u90e8\u5206\u672a\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u4e8e\u78c1\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548c\u7535\u4e3b\u5bfc\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u65b0\u89e3\u7c7b\uff1b\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u5bf9\u771f\u7a7a\u9000\u5316\u573a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u5ea6\u78c1\u5316\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing methods, predominantly graph-based or attention-driven, rely on similarity-driven connectivity assumptions, neglecting asymmetric flow exchanges that govern system evolution. We propose Spatio-Temporal Flow, a physics-inspired paradigm that explicitly models dynamic node couplings through quantifiable flow transfers governed by conservation principles. Building on this, we design FlowNet, a novel architecture leveraging flow tokens as information carriers to simulate source-to-destination transfers via Flow Allocation Modules, ensuring state redistribution aligns with conservation laws. FlowNet dynamically adjusts the interaction radius through an Adaptive Spatial Masking module, suppressing irrelevant noise while enabling context-aware propagation.

Unlike $f(R,T)$ or $f(R,\\mathcal L_m)$ theories, this construction alters how matter curves spacetime without introducing extra geometric degrees of freedom, thereby remaining consistent with local tests of gravity. Physically, the factor $\u03c6(T)\\mathcal L_m$ can be interpreted as an effective renormalization of the matter sector, relevant at high densities and smoothly reducing to GR at low densities. Within this setup we identify a robust window in parameter space leading to a smooth and nonsingular cosmological bounce, with bounded density, finite $\\dot H>0$ at the bounce, and preservation of the infrared limit where $\u039b$CDM is recovered.

We consider the quantum control problem of optimal state transfer between two isospectral density matrices, over an arbitrary finite time horizon, for the quantum Lambda system. The cost considered is a compromise between the energy of the control field and the average occupancy in the highest energy level. We apply a geometric approach that combines the use of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, a symmetry reduction technique to reduce the number of parameters in the resulting optimization problem, and several auxiliary techniques to bound the parameter space in the search for the optimal solution. We prove several properties of the optimal control and trajectories for this problem, including their normality and smoothness. We obtain a system of differential equations that must be satisfied by the optimal pair of control and trajectory we treat in detail, with numerical simulations, and solve a case study involving a Hadamard-like transformation.

Using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, we constrain the parameters of the exponential $f(R)$ model in combination with the total neutrino mass $\\sum m_\u03bd$, employing the latest measurements from cosmic chronometers, the DESI DR2 BAO data, the CMB acoustic scale, and the Pantheon+ supernovae compilation, comparing the results with the $\u039b$CDM and the $w_0w_a$CDM models. Our results show that the exponential $f(R)$ model remains consistent with current observations while slightly alleviating the Hubble tension and the neutrino mass problem relative to $\u039b$CDM, although the constraints on $\\sum m_\u03bd$ are tighter than those obtained for the phenomenological $w_0w_a$CDM scenario.

The performance of these codes is evaluated against loss and dephasing noises using the Knill-Laflamme violation function and benchmarked against cat codes. As the number $m$ of squeezed-vacuum states in a code increases, the code exhibits improved loss tolerance at the cost of higher dephasing sensitivity.

We present FiCABU (Fisher-based Context-Adaptive Balanced Unlearning), a software-hardware co-design that brings unlearning to edge AI processors. FiCABU combines (i) Context-Adaptive Unlearning, which begins edits from back-end layers and halts once the target forgetting is reached, with (ii) Balanced Dampening, which scales dampening strength by depth to preserve retain accuracy. These methods are realized in a full RTL design of a RISC-V edge AI processor that integrates two lightweight IPs for Fisher estimation and dampening into a GEMM-centric streaming pipeline, validated on an FPGA prototype and synthesized in 45 nm for power analysis. Across CIFAR-20 and PinsFaceRecognition with ResNet-18 and ViT, FiCABU achieves random-guess forget accuracy while matching the retraining-free Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD) baseline on retain accuracy, reducing computation by up to 87.52 percent (ResNet-18) and 71.03 percent (ViT). On the INT8 hardware prototype, FiCABU further improves retain preservation and reduces energy to 6.48 percent (CIFAR-20) and 0.13 percent (PinsFaceRecognition) of the SSD baseline.

Bayesian inference for GW lensing with conventional sampling methods is costly, and the problem is exacerbated by the rapidly growing GW catalog. Moreover, assessing the statistical significance of lensed candidates requires thousands, if not millions, of simulations to estimate the background from noise fluctuations and waveform systematics, which is infeasible with standard samplers. We present a novel method, \\texttt{DINGO-lensing}, for performing inference on lensed GWs, extending the neural posterior estimation framework \\texttt{DINGO}. By comparing our results with those using conventional samplers, we show that the compute time of parameter estimation of lensed GWs can be reduced from weeks to seconds, while preserving accuracy both in the posterior distributions and the evidence ratios. We train our neural networks with LIGO detector noise at design sensitivity and a lens model that accommodates two overlapping chirps with opposite parity. We show that the lensing parameters are recovered with millisecond precision for the time delays.

High-rate quantum LDPC codes can reduce error correction overhead, yet realizing high-rate fault-tolerant computation with these codes remains a central challenge. Apart of the lattice surgery approach, standard schemes for realizing logical gates have so far been restricted to performing global operations on all logical qubits at the same time. Another approach relies on low-rate code switching methods. In this work, we introduce a gate-based protocol for addressable single- and multi-qubit Clifford operations on individual logical qubits encoded within one or more quantum LDPC codes. Our scheme leverages logical transversal operations via an auxiliary Bacon-Shor code to perform logical operations with constant time overhead enabled by teleportation. We demonstrate the implementation of an overcomplete logical Clifford gate set and perform numerical simulations to evaluate the error-correction performance of our protocol.

Clifford circuits are a special class of quantum circuits that can be simulated in polynomial time but still show important quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we present an algorithm that simulates Clifford circuits by performing Gaussian elimination on a modified adjacency matrix derived from the circuit structure. Our work builds on an ZX-calculus tensor network representation of Clifford circuits that reduces to quantum graph states. We give a concise formula of amplitudes of graph states based on the LDL decomposition of matrices over GF(2), and use it to get efficient algorithms for strong and weak simulation of Clifford circuits using tree-decomposition-based fast LDL algorithm. The complexity of our algorithm matches the state of art for weak graph state simulation and improves the state of art for strong graph state simulation by taking advantage of Strassen-like fast matrix multiplication. Our algorithm is also efficient when computing many amplitudes or samples of a Clifford circuit. Further, our amplitudes formula provides a new characterization of locally Clifford equivalent graph states as well as an efficient protocol to learn graph states with low-rank adjacency matrices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u6d88\u5143\u548cLDL\u5206\u89e3\u7684Clifford\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u62df\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u56fe\u6001\u5f3a\u6a21\u62df\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u56fe\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "Clifford\u7535\u8def\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5c55\u73b0\u91cd\u8981\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u5982\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u8def\u7ed3\u6784\u6784\u5efa\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6d88\u5143\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u5feb\u901fLDL\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u5f31\u56fe\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5f3a\u56fe\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u6027\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7Strassen\u7c7b\u5feb\u901f\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3aClifford\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u4f4e\u79e9\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u56fe\u6001\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u534f\u8bae\u3002"}}

These quantum neurons are designed to replace the electronic components in ONNs, which typically introduce delays and substantial energy consumption during nonlinear activation. To evaluate the performance of the QONN, we apply it to the MNIST digit classification task, considering the effects of photon absorption duration, random atom-cavity detuning, and stochastic photon loss.

These advancements have solved major obstacles, but also exposed new challenges. For example, processes that were not previously considered bottlenecks, such as hardware synthesis, are becoming limiting factors in the rapid iteration of designs. To mitigate these emerging constraints, multiple efforts have been undertaken to develop an ML-based surrogate model that estimates resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. We introduce wa-hls4ml, a benchmark for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, and its corresponding initial dataset of over 680,000 fully connected and convolutional neural networks, all synthesized using hls4ml and targeting Xilinx FPGAs. The benchmark evaluates the performance of resource and latency predictors against several common ML model architectures, primarily originating from scientific domains, as exemplar models, and the average performance across a subset of the dataset. Additionally, we introduce GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models that predict latency and resources for ML accelerators. We present the architecture and performance of the models and find that the models generally predict latency and resources for the 75% percentile within several percent of the synthesized resources on the synthetic test dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86wa-hls4ml\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ca\u5176\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u548cTransformer\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4bFPGA\u4e0aML\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u5408\u6210\u7b49\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6210\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eML\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1ML\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165wa-hls4ml\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5305\u542b68\u4e07\u591a\u4e2a\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528hls4ml\u5408\u6210\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9Xilinx FPGA\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u548cTransformer\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf975%\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u8d44\u6e90\u76f8\u5dee\u51e0\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4bML\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u786c\u4ef6\u5408\u6210\u6210\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fed\u4ee3\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, unwanted interactions with bulk phonons in their host environment strongly limit their coherence and controllability. We report single color centers in nanodiamonds that are strongly and comprehensively decoupled from the bulk phononic environment. The color centers feature record-narrow linewidths down to 0.3 nm at room temperature and stable, bright emission, exceeding 10 Mcps in saturation. Notably, the bulk phonon sideband is almost entirely suppressed, revealing the presence of a single localized vibrational mode outside the diamond phonon band. Our observations and simulations point towards a unique mechanism for phonon decoupling in common wide-gap materials, based on a strongly radiative orbital transition coupled to a localized vibrational mode.

We show that in regular flows (e.g., wavepackets or low-mode superpositions of eigenstates of harmonic oscillators) sample means and/or variances over modest $N$ are consistent with Born-rule moments. In contrast, degenerate superpositions of 3D oscillators with nodal barriers and chaotic Bohmian dynamics exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions and complex flow partitioning, which can yield noticeable finite-sample deviations in the mean and variance. For the spin-1/2 particle, both convective and Pauli currents conserve $|\u03c8|^2$, but they are associated with different velocity fields and thus might yield different finite-sample trajectory statistics.

Our analysis captures how an algorithm's empirical beliefs, encoded through historical reward averages, create momentum that resists new evidence after a change. We show how this inertia can be exploited to construct adversarial instances that mislead classical algorithms such as Explore Then Commit, epsilon greedy, and UCB, causing them to suffer regret that grows linearly with T and with a substantial constant factor, regardless of how their parameters are tuned, even with a single change point.\n  We extend the analysis to algorithms that periodically restart to handle non stationarity and prove that, even then, the worst case regret remains linear in T.

This complexity poses a significant challenge to understanding their internal learning mechanisms. In this work, we propose a novel analytical framework that recasts a multi-layer ReLU network into an equivalent single-layer linear model with input-dependent \"effective weights\". For any given input sample, the activation pattern of ReLU units creates a unique computational path, effectively zeroing out a subset of weights in the network. By composing the active weights across all layers, we can derive an effective weight matrix, $W_{\\text{eff}}(x)$, that maps the input directly to the output for that specific sample. We posit that the evolution of these effective weights reveals fundamental principles of representation learning. Our work demonstrates that as training progresses, the effective weights corresponding to samples from the same class converge, while those from different classes diverge. By tracking the trajectories of these sample-wise effective weights, we provide a new lens through which to interpret the formation of class-specific decision boundaries and the emergence of semantic representations within the network.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u5c42ReLU\u7f51\u7edc\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u4f9d\u8d56\"\u6709\u6548\u6743\u91cd\"\u7684\u7b49\u6548\u5355\u5c42\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f7f\u7528ReLU\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ed9\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7ReLU\u5355\u5143\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u521b\u5efa\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u5c42ReLU\u7f51\u7edc\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u5355\u5c42\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635W_eff(x)\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u7c7b\u522b\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6743\u91cd\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6743\u91cd\u4f1a\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\u3002"}}

While data-driven models show promise in SST prediction, their black-box nature often limits interpretability and overlooks key physical processes. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been gaining momentum but struggle with complex ocean-atmosphere dynamics due to 1) inadequate characterization of seawater movement (e.g., coastal upwelling) and 2) insufficient integration of external SST drivers (e.g., turbulent heat fluxes). To address these challenges, we propose SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) framework for SST prediction. First, we derive ODEs from fluid transport principles, incorporating both advection and diffusion to model ocean spatiotemporal dynamics. Through variational optimization, we recover a latent velocity field that explicitly governs the temporal dynamics of SST. Building upon ODE, we introduce an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI)-inspired by ocean heat budget equations-to account for external forcing factors. Thus, the variations in the components of these factors provide deeper insights into SST dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art performances in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, SSTODE visually reveals the impact of advection dynamics, thermal diffusion patterns, and diurnal heating-cooling cycles on SST evolution. These findings demonstrate the model's interpretability and physical consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SSTODE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6539\u8fdb\u6d77\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u5173\u952e\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6d77\u6d0b-\u5927\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6d77\u6c34\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6d41\u4f53\u8f93\u8fd0\u539f\u7406\u63a8\u5bfcODE\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u6d41\u548c\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u6d77\u6d0b\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u6062\u590d\u6f5c\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u80fd\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u6574\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u5f3a\u8feb\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u533a\u57dfSST\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e73\u6d41\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u70ed\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u663c\u591c\u52a0\u70ed-\u51b7\u5374\u5faa\u73af\u5bf9SST\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "SSTODE\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3SST\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002"}}

By analyzing the Gaussian quantum coherence of the cavity, magnonic, and mechanical subsystems, as well as the total system coherence, we identify the critical roles of phase control, coupling strength, drive power, and thermal noise. We show that the squeezing amplitude and phase precisely modulate the effective magnon frequency and damping, enabling phase-dependent enhancement and nonreciprocal transfer of coherence. Our systematic parameter analysis indicates that increasing driving power and photon-magnon coupling enhances quantum coherence, while thermal decoherence leads to its degradation. However, this effect is partially suppressed by the presence of magnon squeezing. The results show that squeezed magnons are a robust and tunable resource for controlling, stabilizing, and optimizing quantum coherence in cavity magnomechanical platforms, offering potential applications in hybrid magnonic systems and coherent quantum information processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u78c1\u5b50\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8154\u78c1\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5404\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u603b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u538b\u7f29\u53c2\u6570\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u63a7\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u529f\u7387\u548c\u70ed\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u538b\u7f29\u78c1\u5b50\u9a71\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u8c03\u63a7\u6df7\u5408\u8154\u78c1\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u548c\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8154\u3001\u78c1\u5b50\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684Gaussian\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u4f4d\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u9a71\u52a8\u529f\u7387\u548c\u70ed\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u538b\u7f29\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u63a7\u6709\u6548\u78c1\u5b50\u9891\u7387\u548c\u963b\u5c3c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u8f6c\u79fb\uff1b\u9a71\u52a8\u529f\u7387\u548c\u5149\u5b50-\u78c1\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u70ed\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u88ab\u78c1\u5b50\u538b\u7f29\u90e8\u5206\u6291\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u538b\u7f29\u78c1\u5b50\u662f\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8154\u78c1\u673a\u68b0\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u78c1\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u76f8\u5e72\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, due to its iterative refinement process, the inference is often bottlenecked by slow and static sampling speed. To overcome this problem, we introduce `KL-Adaptive Stability Sampling' (KLASS), a fast yet effective sampling method that exploits token-level KL divergence to identify stable, high-confidence predictions. By unmasking multiple tokens in each iteration without any additional model training, our approach speeds up generation significantly while maintaining sample quality. On reasoning benchmarks, KLASS achieves up to $2.78\\times$ wall-clock speedups while improving performance over standard greedy decoding, attaining state-of-the-art results among diffusion-based samplers.

Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning (DRRL) addresses this by optimizing for worst-case performance within an uncertainty set defined by a robustness budget $\u03b5$. However, fixing $\u03b5$ results in a tradeoff between performance and robustness: small values yield high nominal performance but weak robustness, while large values can result in instability and overly conservative policies. We propose Distributionally Robust Self-Paced Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (DR-SPCRL), a method that overcomes this limitation by treating $\u03b5$ as a continuous curriculum. DR-SPCRL adaptively schedules the robustness budget according to the agent's progress, enabling a balance between nominal and robust performance. Empirical results across multiple environments demonstrate that DR-SPCRL not only stabilizes training but also achieves a superior robustness-performance trade-off, yielding an average 11.8\\% increase in episodic return under varying perturbations compared to fixed or heuristic scheduling strategies, and achieving approximately 1.9$\\times$ the performance of the corresponding nominal RL algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDR-SPCRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\u03b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfDRRL\u4e2d\u56fa\u5b9a\u03b5\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7ecf\u5e38\u56e0\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u800c\u5931\u6548\u3002\u4f20\u7edfDRRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u56fa\u5b9a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\u03b5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5c0f\u03b5\u503c\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u540d\u4e49\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f31\uff0c\u5927\u03b5\u503c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "DR-SPCRL\u5c06\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\u03b5\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u5c55\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u540d\u4e49\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cDR-SPCRL\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u6216\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u5747\u83b7\u5f9711.8%\u7684\u56de\u5408\u56de\u62a5\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u540d\u4e49RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ea61.9\u500d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DR-SPCRL\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DRRL\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Building upon the two-state B92 protocol, phiQKD replaces the traditional unambiguous state discrimination (IDP) measurement with a one-parameter family of hybrid POVMs characterized by a tilting angle $\u03c6$. This allows for continuous control over the trade-off among correct, incorrect, and inconclusive outcomes. While the asymptotic key rate improvement over B92 is modest, phiQKD offers a practical advantage by enabling adaptability to noise and channel imperfections via measurement tunability.

Steele"], "title": "Flux-modulated tunable interaction regimes in two strongly nonlinear oscillators", "comment": null, "summary": "The ability to efficiently simulate a variety of interacting quantum systems on a single device is an overarching goal for digital and analog quantum simulators. In circuit quantum electrodynamical systems, strongly nonlinear superconducting oscillators are typically realized using transmon qubits, featuring a wide range of tunable couplings that are mainly achieved via flux-dependent inductive elements. Such controllability is highly desirable both for digital quantum information processing and for analog quantum simulations of various physical phenomena, such as arbitrary spin-spin interactions. Furthermore, broad tunability facilitates the study of driven-dissipative oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored parameter regimes. In this work, we demonstrate the ability to selectively activate different dynamical regimes between two strongly nonlinear oscillators using parametric modulation.

Finally, we observe level repulsion and attraction between Kerr-nonlinear oscillators in regimes where the nonlinearities exceed the coupling strengths and decay rates of the system.

The d-dimensional logical qudit encoding with distance-3 (or 5) codewords can be designed within a 12d (or 40d)-dimensional Hilbert space, and the design can be further generalized to 2t+1-distance codes and to encodings exploiting multiple physical qudits.

Traditional computational models often rely on structural information alone and thus fail to capture the genetic determinants that influence disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. To address this gap, we propose GastroDL-Fusion, a dual-modal deep learning framework that integrates protein-ligand complex data with disease-associated gene sequence information for drug and vaccine development. In our approach, protein-ligand complexes are represented as molecular graphs and modeled using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), while gene sequences are encoded into biologically meaningful embeddings via a pre-trained Transformer (ProtBERT/ESM). These complementary modalities are fused through a multi-layer perceptron to enable robust cross-modal interaction learning. We evaluate the model on benchmark datasets of GI disease-related targets, demonstrating that GastroDL-Fusion significantly improves predictive performance over conventional methods. Specifically, the model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.12 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.75, outperforming CNN, BiLSTM, GIN, and Transformer-only baselines.

Our approach uses VQE to block-diagonalize the cluster Hamiltonian through a single-unitary transformation. This unitary is then post-processed using the projective cluster-additive transformation (PCAT) to ensure cluster additivity, a key requirement for NLCE convergence. We benchmark our method on the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one and two dimensions, and with longitudinal field, computing one quasi-particle dispersions in the high-field polarized phase. We compare two cost function classes, trace minimization and variance-based, demonstrating their effectiveness with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz (HVA). For pure TFIM, $\\lceil N/2 \\rceil$ layers suffice: NLCE+VQE matches exact diagonalization. For TFIM with longitudinal field, where parity symmetry breaks and PCAT becomes essential, both $\\lceil N/2 \\rceil$ and $N$ layers converge with increasing cluster size, with $N$ layers providing improved accuracy. Our results establish PCAT as a cluster-additive framework that extends variational quantum algorithms to excited-state calculations in the thermodynamic limit via NLCE.

The central innovation of QiVC lies in its quantum-inspired rotated ensemble (QiRE) mechanism. QiRE performs differentiable low-dimensional subspace rotations of convolutional weights, analogously to quantum state evolution. This approach enables structured uncertainty modeling while preserving the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space, resulting in more expressive, stable, and uncertainty-aware representations. To demonstrate its practical potential, the concept is instantiated in a QiVC-based convolutional network (QiVC-Net) and evaluated in the context of biosignal classification, focusing on phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings, a challenging domain characterized by high noise, inter-subject variability, and often imbalanced data. The proposed QiVC-Net integrates an architecture in which the QiVC layer does not introduce additional parameters, instead performing an ensemble rotation of the convolutional weights through a structured mechanism ensuring robustness without added highly computational burden.

We propose an active learning algorithm (\"PartiBandits\") to estimate $\\mathbb{E}[Y]$.

PartiBandits is essentially a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, it learns a partition of the unlabeled data that shrinks the average conditional variance of $Y$. In the second stage it uses a UCB-style subroutine (\"WarmStart-UCB\") to request labels from each stratum round-by-round. Both the main algorithm's and the subroutine's convergence rates are minimax optimal in classical settings. PartiBandits bridges the UCB and disagreement-based approaches to active learning despite these two approaches being designed to tackle very different tasks.

The recently introduced Clifford Augmented Matrix Product State (CAMPS) method offer scalability and efficiency by combining both tensor network and stabilizer simulation techniques and leveraging their complementary advantages. This hybrid simulation method has indeed demonstrated significant improvements in simulation performance for qubit circuits. Our work generalises the CAMPS method to higher quantum degrees of freedom -- qudit simulation, resulting in a generalised CAMPS (GCAMPS). Benchmarking this extended simulator on quantum systems with three degrees of freedom, i.e. qutrits, we show that similar to the case of qubits, qutrit systems also benefit from a comparable speedup using these techniques. Indeed, we see a greater improvement with qutrit simulation compared to qubit simulation on the same $T$-doped random Clifford benchmarking circuit as a result of the increased difficulty of conventional qutrit simulation using tensor networks.

While SAEs provide crucial insights into LLM explanations, their practical adoption faces a fundamental challenge: better interpretability demands that SAEs' hidden layers have high dimensionality to satisfy sparsity constraints, resulting in prohibitive training and inference costs. Recent Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches attempt to address this by partitioning SAEs into narrower expert networks with gated activation, thereby reducing computation. In a well-designed MoE, each expert should focus on learning a distinct set of features. However, we identify a \\textit{critical limitation} in MoE-SAE: Experts often fail to specialize, which means they frequently learn overlapping or identical features.

Lossy compression of gradient data can mitigate this overhead, and error-bounded lossy compression (EBLC) is particularly appealing for its fine-grained utility-compression tradeoff. However, existing EBLC methods (e.g., SZ), originally designed for smooth scientific data with strong spatial locality, rely on generic predictors such as Lorenzo and interpolation for entropy reduction to improve compression ratio. Gradient tensors, in contrast, exhibit low smoothness and weak spatial correlation, rendering these predictors ineffective and leading to poor compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose an EBLC framework tailored for FL gradient data to achieve high compression ratios while preserving model accuracy. The core of it is an innovative prediction mechanism that exploits temporal correlations across FL training rounds and structural regularities within convolutional kernels to reduce residual entropy. The predictor is compatible with standard quantizers and entropy coders and comprises (1) a cross-round magnitude predictor based on a normalized exponential moving average, and (2) a sign predictor that leverages gradient oscillation and kernel-level sign consistency. Experiments show that this new EBLC yields up to 1.53x higher compression ratios than SZ3 with lower accuracy loss.

While expanding the quantum ISA with high-fidelity, expressive basis gates is a key path forward, it imposes significant gate calibration overhead and complicates compiler optimization. As a result, even though more powerful ISAs have been designed, their use remains largely conceptual rather than practical.\n  To move beyond these hurdles, we introduce the concept of \"reconfigurable quantum instruction set computers\" (ReQISC), which incorporates: (1) a unified microarchitecture capable of directly implementing arbitrary 2Q gates equivalently, i.e., SU(4) modulo 1Q rotations, with theoretically optimal gate durations given any 2Q coupling Hamiltonians; (2) a compilation framework tailored to ReQISC primitives for end-to-end synthesis and optimization, comprising a program-aware pass that refines high-level representations, a program-agnostic pass for aggressive circuit-level optimization, and an SU(4)-aware routing pass that minimizes hardware mapping overhead.\n  We detail the hardware implementation to demonstrate the feasibility, in terms of both pulse control and calibration of this superior gate scheme on realistic hardware. By leveraging the expressivity of SU(4) and the time minimality realized by the underlying microarchitecture, the SU(4)-based ISA achieves remarkable performance, with a 4.97-fold reduction in average pulse duration to implement arbitrary 2Q gates, compared to the usual CNOT/CZ scheme on mainstream flux-tunable transmons. Supported by the end-to-end compiler, ReQISC outperforms the conventional CNOT-ISA, SOTA compiler, and pulse implementation counterparts, in significantly reducing 2Q gate counts, circuit depth, pulse duration, qubit mapping overhead, and program fidelity losses. For the first time, ReQISC makes the theoretical benefits of continuous ISAs practically feasible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u91cf\u5b50\u6307\u4ee4\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a(ReQISC)\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u53cc\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u95e8(SU(4)\u6a21\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u65cb\u8f6c)\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u7528\u7f16\u8bd1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u91cf\u5b50ISA\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5e26\u6765\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u95e8\u6821\u51c6\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684ISA\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1ReQISC\u5305\u542b\uff1a(1)\u7edf\u4e00\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f2Q\u95e8(SU(4)\u6a211Q\u65cb\u8f6c)\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u95e8\u65f6\u957f\uff1b(2)\u4e13\u7528\u7f16\u8bd1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7a0b\u5e8f\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u65e0\u5173\u7535\u8def\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u548cSU(4)\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e3b\u6d41\u901a\u91cf\u53ef\u8c03transmon\u7684CNOT/CZ\u65b9\u6848\uff0cSU(4)\u57faISA\u5e73\u5747\u8109\u51b2\u65f6\u957f\u51cf\u5c114.97\u500d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e2Q\u95e8\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u8109\u51b2\u65f6\u957f\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6620\u5c04\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "ReQISC\u9996\u6b21\u4f7f\u8fde\u7eedISA\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCNOT-ISA\u3001\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing approaches often rely on pre-segmented, within-activity data and overlook the physical layout of the environment, limiting their robustness in continuous, real-world deployments. In this paper, we propose MARAuder's Map, a novel framework for real-time activity recognition from raw, unsegmented sensor streams. Our method projects sensor activations onto the physical floorplan to generate trajectory-aware, image-like sequences that capture the spatial flow of human movement. These representations are processed by a hybrid deep learning model that jointly captures spatial structure and temporal dependencies. To enhance temporal awareness, we introduce a learnable time embedding module that encodes contextual cues such as hour-of-day and day-of-week. Additionally, an attention-based encoder selectively focuses on informative segments within each observation window, enabling accurate recognition even under cross-activity transitions and temporal ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world smart home datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines, offering a practical solution for real-time HAR in ambient sensor environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMARAuder's Map\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u672a\u5206\u6bb5\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7269\u7406\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5206\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u73af\u5883\u7269\u7406\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7269\u7406\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u5408\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5757\u7f16\u7801\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5173\u6ce8\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MARAuder's Map\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process.

One major challenge in realizing surface-code-based FTQC is the extremely large number of qubits required. To mitigate this problem, fusing multiple codewords of the surface code into a densely packed configuration has been proposed. It is known that by using dense packing, the number of physical qubits required per logical qubit can be reduced to approximately three-fourths compared to simply placing surface-code patches side by side. Despite its potential, concrete deformation procedures and quantitative error-rate analyses have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we present a detailed code-deformation procedure that transforms multiple standard surface code patches into a densely packed, connected configuration, along with a conceptual microarchitecture to utilize this dense packing. We also propose a CNOT gate-scheduling for stabilizer measurement circuits that suppresses hook errors in the densely packed surface code. We performed circuit-level Monte Carlo noise simulation of densely packed surface codes using this gate scheduling. The numerical results demonstrate that as the code distance of the densely packed surface code increases and the physical error rate decreases, the logical error rate of the densely packed surface code becomes lower than that of the standard surface code. Furthermore, we find that only when employing hook-error-avoiding syndrome extraction can the densely packed surface code achieve a lower logical error rate than the standard surface code, while simultaneously reducing the space overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8868\u9762\u7801\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u6253\u5305\u914d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u5f62\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u8868\u9762\u7801\u8865\u4e01\u878d\u5408\u6210\u5bc6\u96c6\u8fde\u63a5\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u907f\u514d\u94a9\u9519\u8bef\u7684CNOT\u95e8\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u8868\u9762\u7801\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8868\u9762\u7801\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u3002\u5bc6\u96c6\u6253\u5305\u914d\u7f6e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea6\u56db\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u5206\u6790\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u5f62\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u8868\u9762\u7801\u8865\u4e01\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u6253\u5305\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6291\u5236\u94a9\u9519\u8bef\u7684CNOT\u95e8\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\u7528\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7535\u8def\u7ea7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5bc6\u96c6\u6253\u5305\u8868\u9762\u7801\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8ddd\u79bb\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u7269\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5176\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u8868\u9762\u7801\u3002\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u91c7\u7528\u907f\u514d\u94a9\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\uff0c\u5bc6\u96c6\u6253\u5305\u8868\u9762\u7801\u624d\u80fd\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bc6\u96c6\u6253\u5305\u8868\u9762\u7801\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u95e8\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u8868\u9762\u7801\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this setting, a learner repeatedly selects arms and observes reward vectors, aiming to maximize the reward for the highest-priority objective, then the next, and so on. While previous studies have primarily focused on regret minimization, this work bridges the gap between \\textit{regret minimization} and \\textit{best arm identification} under lexicographic preferences. We propose two elimination-based algorithms to address this joint objective. The first algorithm eliminates suboptimal arms sequentially, layer by layer, in accordance with the objective priorities, and achieves sample complexity and regret bounds comparable to those of the best single-objective algorithms. The second algorithm simultaneously leverages reward information from all objectives in each round, effectively exploiting cross-objective dependencies. Remarkably, it outperforms the known lower bound for the single-objective bandit problem, highlighting the benefit of cross-objective information sharing in the multi-objective setting.

While entanglement and coherence are critical to many quantum algorithms, our results indicate that they do not fully explain the quantum advantage achieved by the Grover search algorithm. By introducing a generalized Grover search algorithm, we demonstrate that the success probability depends not only on the querying number of oracles but also on the coherence fraction, which quantifies the fidelity between an arbitrary initial quantum state and the equal superposition state. Additionally, we explore the role of the coherence fraction in the quantum minimization algorithm, which offers a framework for solving complex problems in quantum machine learning.

We introduce a diagnostic that requires no additional training and uses only the forward pass to emit a binary accept or reject signal during agent execution. The method analyzes token graphs induced by attention and computes two spectral statistics in early layers, namely the high frequency energy ratio and spectral entropy. We formalize these signals, establish invariances, and provide finite sample estimators with uncertainty quantification. Under a two regime mixture assumption with a monotone likelihood ratio property, we show that a single threshold on the high frequency energy ratio is optimal in the Bayes sense for detecting context inconsistency. Empirically, the high frequency energy ratio exhibits robust bimodality during context verification across multiple model families, which enables gating decisions with overhead below one millisecond on our hardware and configurations. We demonstrate integration into retrieval augmented agent pipelines and discuss deployment as an inline safety monitor.

Recent theoretical studies have offered much insights into these phenomena through the non-Bloch band theory, though many of the theory's key features are experimentally elusive. For instance, the correspondence between complex momenta and non-Hermitian bands, while central to non-Bloch band theory, has so far defied direct experimental observation. Here we experimentally study the non-Hermitian spectral deformation in complex-momentum space, by implementing a non-Hermitian lattice with long-range couplings in the synthetic orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) dimension of photons inside a degenerate cavity. Encoding the complex momenta in the phase and amplitude modulations of the OAM modes, and devising a complex-momentum-resolved projective detection, we reconstruct the spectral deformation in momentum space, where the eigenspectrum on the complex plane morphs through distinct geometries. This enables us to experimentally extract key information of the system under the non-Bloch band theory, including exceptional points in the complex-momentum space, the open-boundary spectra, and the generalized Brillouin zone.

Sjoding", "Jenna Wiens"], "title": "Measuring Model Performance in the Presence of an Intervention", "comment": "AAAI 2026", "summary": "AI models are often evaluated based on their ability to predict the outcome of interest. However, in many AI for social impact applications, the presence of an intervention that affects the outcome can bias the evaluation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assign interventions, allowing data from the control group to be used for unbiased model evaluation. However, this approach is inefficient because it ignores data from the treatment group. Given the complexity and cost often associated with RCTs, making the most use of the data is essential. Thus, we investigate model evaluation strategies that leverage all data from an RCT. First, we theoretically quantify the estimation bias that arises from na\u00efvely aggregating performance estimates from treatment and control groups, and derive the condition under which this bias leads to incorrect model selection. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose nuisance parameter weighting (NPW), an unbiased model evaluation approach that reweights data from the treatment group to mimic the distributions of samples that would or would not experience the outcome under no intervention. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed evaluation approach consistently yields better model selection than the standard approach, which ignores data from the treatment group, across various intervention effect and sample size settings. Our contribution represents a meaningful step towards more efficient model evaluation in real-world contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528RCT\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08NPW\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728AI\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u504f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u6d6a\u8d39\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86nuisance parameter weighting (NPW)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u65e0\u5e72\u9884\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u751f\u6216\u4e0d\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u65e0\u504f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNPW\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u5ffd\u7565\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528RCT\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the reduced numerical precision of FP8 poses challenges for stable and accurate training. Current frameworks preserve training performance using mixed-granularity quantization, i.e., applying per-group quantization for activations and per-tensor/block quantization for weights. While effective, per-group quantization requires scaling along the inner dimension of matrix multiplication, introducing additional dequantization overhead. Moreover, these frameworks often rely on just-in-time scaling to dynamically adjust scaling factors based on the current data distribution. However, this online quantization is inefficient for FP8 training, as it involves multiple memory reads and writes that negate the performance benefits of FP8. To overcome these limitations, we propose MOSS, a novel FP8 training framework that ensures both efficiency and numerical stability. MOSS introduces two key innovations: (1) a two-level microscaling strategy for quantizing sensitive activations, which balances precision and dequantization cost by combining a high-precision global scale with compact, power-of-two local scales; and (2) automatic scaling for weights in linear layers, which eliminates the need for costly max-reduction operations by predicting and adjusting scaling factors during training. Leveraging these techniques, MOSS enables efficient FP8 training of a 7B parameter model, achieving performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while achieving up to 34% higher training throughput.", "AI": {"tldr": "MOSS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684FP8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u7ea7\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6743\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86FP8\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57287B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0eBF16\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe34%\u3002", "motivation": "FP8\u683c\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ed9\u7a33\u5b9a\u51c6\u786e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53cd\u91cf\u5316\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "MOSS\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a(1) \u654f\u611f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u4e24\u7ea7\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5168\u5c40\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5e42\u6b21\u5c40\u90e8\u7f29\u653e\uff1b(2) \u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u6d88\u9664\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5f52\u7ea6\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "MOSS\u57287B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0eBF16\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe34%\u3002", "conclusion": "MOSS\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86FP8\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

One of the major challenges of MoE models is that they usually require much more memory than their dense counterparts due to their unique architecture, and hence are harder to deploy in environments with limited GPU memory, such as edge devices. MoE offloading is a promising technique proposed to overcome this challenge, especially if it is enhanced with caching and pre-fetching, but prior work stopped at suboptimal caching algorithm and offered limited insights. In this work, we study MoE offloading in depth and make the following contributions: 1. We analyze the expert activation and LRU caching behavior in detail and provide traces. 2. We propose LFU caching optimization based on our analysis and obtain strong improvements from LRU. 3.

These Lie algebras are contained in the real skew-hermitian Weyl algebra $\\hat{A}_1$, defined as the real subalgebra of the Weyl algebra $A_1$ consisting of all skew-hermitian polynomials. A central aspect of our analysis is the choice of basis for $\\hat{A}_1$, which is composed of skew-symmetric combinations of two elements of the Weyl algebra called monomials, namely strings of creation and annihilation operators combined with their hermitian conjugate. Motivated by the quest for analytical solutions in quantum optimal control and dynamics, we aim at answering the following three fundamental questions: (i) What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\\hat{A}_1$ generated by monomials alone? (ii)~What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\\hat{A}_1$ that contain the free Hamiltonian? (iii) What are the non-abelian and finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras that can be faithfully realized in $\\hat{A}_1$? We answer the first question by providing all possible realizations of all finite-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebras that are generated by monomials alone. We answer the second question by proving that any non-abelian and finite-dimensional subalgebra of $\\hat{A}_1$ that contains a free Hamiltonian term must be a subalgebra of the Schr\u00f6dinger algebra. We partially answer the third question by classifying all nilpotent and non-solvable Lie algebras that can be realized in $\\hat{A}_1$, and comment on the remaining cases. Finally, we also discuss the implications of our results for quantum control theory.

Central to realizing the potential of quantum computing are perfect entangling (PE) two-qubit gates, which serve as a critical building block for universal quantum computation. In the context of quantum optimal control, shaping electromagnetic pulses to drive quantum gates is crucial for pushing gate performance toward theoretical limits. In this work, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to discover near-optimal pulse shapes that yield PE gates.

Quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques are leading solutions to improve computation fidelity with relatively low qubit-overhead, while full-scale quantum error correction remains a distant goal. However, QEM techniques incur substantial measurement overheads, especially when applied to families of quantum circuits parameterized by classical inputs. Focusing on zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a widely adopted QEM technique, here we devise the surrogate-enabled ZNE (S-ZNE), which leverages classical learning surrogates to perform ZNE entirely on the classical side. Unlike conventional ZNE, whose measurement cost scales linearly with the number of circuits, S-ZNE requires only constant measurement overhead for an entire family of quantum circuits, offering superior scalability. Theoretical analysis indicates that S-ZNE achieves accuracy comparable to conventional ZNE in many practical scenarios, and numerical experiments on up to 100-qubit ground-state energy and quantum metrology tasks confirm its effectiveness.

However, while these models implicitly compress historical information into their parameters during training, they are unable to explicitly and dynamically access this global knowledge during inference, relying only on the local context within the lookback window. This results in an underutilization of rich patterns from the global history. To bridge this gap, we propose Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past (PFRP), a novel approach that explicitly integrates global historical data to enhance forecasting accuracy. Specifically, we construct a Global Memory Bank (GMB) to effectively store and manage global historical patterns. A retrieval mechanism is then employed to extract similar patterns from the GMB, enabling the generation of global predictions. By adaptively combining these global predictions with the outputs of any local prediction model, PFRP produces more accurate and interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that PFRP significantly enhances the average performance of advanced univariate forecasting models by 8.4\\%.

While recent deep learning approaches have achieved strong performance on single EEG emotion datasets, their generalization across datasets remains limited due to the heterogeneity in annotation schemes and data formats. Existing models typically require dataset-specific architectures tailored to input structure and lack semantic alignment across diverse emotion labels. To address these challenges, we propose EMOD: A Unified EEG Emotion Representation Framework Leveraging Valence-Arousal (V-A) Guided Contrastive Learning. EMOD learns transferable and emotion-aware representations from heterogeneous datasets by bridging both semantic and structural gaps. Specifically, we project discrete and continuous emotion labels into a unified V-A space and formulate a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss that encourages emotionally similar samples to cluster in the latent space. To accommodate variable EEG formats, EMOD employs a flexible backbone comprising a Triple-Domain Encoder followed by a Spatial-Temporal Transformer, enabling robust extraction and integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial features. We pretrain EMOD on eight public EEG datasets and evaluate its performance on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that EMOD achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong adaptability and generalization across diverse EEG-based emotion recognition scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EMOD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7V-A\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684EEG\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u793a\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u4e00EEG\u60c5\u611f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528V-A\u7a7a\u95f4\u7edf\u4e00\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8f6f\u52a0\u6743\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u91cd\u57df\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u57df\u3001\u9891\u57df\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u516c\u5171EEG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u57283\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cEMOD\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "EMOD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684V-A\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86EEG\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Proposing possibly the first ever application of TabPFN for such a purpose, we adapt and fine-tune the TabPFN model to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), one of the most well-known CO problems. Specifically, we adopt the node-based approach and the node-predicting adaptation strategy to construct the entire TSP route. Our evaluation with varying instance sizes confirms that TabPFN requires minimal training, adapts to TSP using a single sample, performs better generalization across varying TSP instance sizes, and reduces performance degradation. Furthermore, the training process with adaptation and fine-tuning is completed within minutes. The methodology leads to strong solution quality even without post-processing and achieves performance comparable to other models with post-processing refinement.

However, the QBs inevitably losses energy due to their interaction with environment. How to enhance the performance of the QBs in the open-system case remains an important challenge. Here we propose a scheme to realize the driven-dissipative QBs in atom-waveguide-QED systems and demonstrate significant improvements in both the stored energy and extractable work (ergotropy) of the QBs via feedback control. For a single-atom QB, we show that combining the measurement and coherent feedback controls enables nearly perfect stable charging under the weak coherent driving. For the QB array, the measurement-based feedback allows us to control different dynamical phases in the thermodynamic limit: (i) a continuous boundary time-crystal phase, where persistent periodic energy charge-discharge oscillations emerge despite the presence of the dissipation into the waveguide, and (ii) two stationary phases -- one reaches full charge while the other maintains only small energy storage.

One of the key problems in this task is the lack of sufficient labeled logs, which limits the rapid deployment in new systems. Existing works usually leverage large-scale labeled logs from a mature web system and a small amount of labeled logs from a new system, using transfer learning to extract and generalize general knowledge across both domains. However, these methods focus solely on the transfer of general knowledge and neglect the disparity and potential mismatch between such knowledge and the proprietary knowledge of target system, thus constraining performance. To address this limitation, we propose FusionLog, a novel zero-label cross-system log-based anomaly detection method that effectively achieves the fusion of general and proprietary knowledge, enabling cross-system generalization without any labeled target logs. Specifically, we first design a training-free router based on semantic similarity that dynamically partitions unlabeled target logs into 'general logs' and 'proprietary logs.' For general logs, FusionLog employs a small model based on system-agnostic representation meta-learning for direct training and inference, inheriting the general anomaly patterns shared between the source and target systems. For proprietary logs, we iteratively generate pseudo-labels and fine-tune the small model using multi-round collaborative knowledge distillation and fusion based on large language model (LLM) and small model (SM) to enhance its capability to recognize anomaly patterns specific to the target system. Experimental results on three public log datasets from different systems show that FusionLog achieves over 90% F1-score under a fully zero-label setting, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art cross-system log-based anomaly detection methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "FusionLog\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u7b7e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e13\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u65e5\u5fd7\u52a8\u6001\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u65e5\u5fd7\uff1b\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u5173\u8868\u793a\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e13\u6709\u65e5\u5fd7\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u534f\u4f5c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u878d\u5408LLM\u548cSM\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cFusionLog\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FusionLog\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u901a\u7528\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Here we present the first application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for hydrogen crossover prediction, integrating mass conservation, Fick's diffusion law, and Henry's solubility law within a compact architecture (17,793 parameters). Validated across six membranes under industrially relevant conditions (0.05-5.0 A/cm$^2$, 1-200 bar, 25-85\u00b0C), our PINN achieves exceptional accuracy (R$^2$ = 99.84%, RMSE = 0.0348%) with sub-millisecond inference times suitable for real-time control. Remarkably, the model maintains R$^2$ > 86% when predicting crossover at pressures 2.5x beyond training range-substantially outperforming pure neural networks (R$^2$ = 43.4%). The hardware-agnostic deployment, from desktop CPUs to edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4), enables distributed safety monitoring essential for gigawatt-scale installations.

In this paper, we demonstrate a complementary effect: Longer-lived excited atoms turn out to have been accelerated. We propose the following experiment. An excited atom is prepared in a superposition of momenta. Due to relativistic time dilation, in the lab frame, the decay rate of components with higher momentum is diminished. As time passes without the atom emitting a photon, higher-momentum components become more probable. This results in a time-dependent shift of the expectation value of momentum. Taking into account first-order relativistic corrections, we calculate the force and acceleration undergone by the atom due to the fact that it did not emit a photon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u65f6\u95f4\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u6548\u5e94\uff1a\u5bff\u547d\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u7ecf\u5386\u4e86\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u5904\u4e8e\u52a8\u91cf\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u65f6\u95f4\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u9ad8\u52a8\u91cf\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u8870\u53d8\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u672a\u53d1\u5c04\u5149\u5b50\u65f6\u539f\u5b50\u52a8\u91cf\u671f\u671b\u503c\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u65f6\u95f4\u81a8\u80c0\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u53d1\u5c04\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u5982\u4f55\u56e0\u65f6\u95f4\u81a8\u80c0\u6548\u5e94\u800c\u7ecf\u5386\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u8ba9\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u5904\u4e8e\u52a8\u91cf\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u65f6\u95f4\u81a8\u80c0\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u52a8\u91cf\u5206\u91cf\u8870\u53d8\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u672a\u53d1\u5c04\u5149\u5b50\u65f6\u539f\u5b50\u52a8\u91cf\u671f\u671b\u503c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u672a\u53d1\u5c04\u5149\u5b50\uff0c\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u671f\u671b\u503c\u4f1a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d1\u751f\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u529b\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u65f6\u95f4\u81a8\u80c0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5f71\u54cd\u52a0\u901f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u8fd8\u53cd\u8fc7\u6765\u5f71\u54cd\u672a\u8870\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u8054\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Framing the problem as a sequence-to-sequence task, we develop a permutation- and affine-equivariant transformer that estimates both the probability density $f(x)$ and its score $\\nabla_x \\log f(x)$ directly from i.i.d. samples. Unlike traditional score-matching methods that require training a separate model for each distribution, our approach learns a single distribution-agnostic operator that generalizes across densities and sample sizes. The architecture employs cross-attention to connect observed samples with arbitrary query points, enabling generalization beyond the training data, while built-in symmetry constraints ensure equivariance to permutation and affine transformations. Analytically, we show that the attention weights can recover classical kernel density estimation (KDE), and verify it empirically, establishing a principled link between classical KDE and the transformer architecture. Empirically, the model achieves substantially lower error and better scaling than KDE and score-debiased KDE (SD-KDE), while exhibiting better runtime scaling. Together, these results establish transformers as general-purpose, data-adaptive operators for nonparametric density and score estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7f6e\u6362\u548c\u4eff\u5c04\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u72ec\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u6837\u672c\u5927\u5c0f\u8fdb\u884c\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8fde\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\u6837\u672c\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u67e5\u8be2\u70b9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7f6e\u6362\u548c\u4eff\u5c04\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u6062\u590d\u7ecf\u5178\u6838\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfKDE\u548cSD-KDE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u7ecf\u5178KDE\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178KDE\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In this study, we performed survival analysis to predict hospitalization and death in COPD patients using longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), comparing statistical models, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches. We analyzed data from more than 150k patients from the SIDIAP database in Catalonia, Spain, from 2013 to 2017, modeling hospitalization as a first event and death as a semi-competing terminal event. Multiple models were evaluated, including Cox proportional hazards, SurvivalBoost, DeepPseudo, SurvTRACE, Dynamic Deep-Hit, and Deep Recurrent Survival Machine. Results showed that DL models utilizing recurrent architectures outperformed both ML and linear approaches in concordance and time-dependent AUC, especially for hospitalization, which proved to be the harder event to predict.

Such skeletons have previously been found in classes of free-fermion models. For the translation-invariant BDI and AIII free-fermion classes, it has been shown that the underlying skeleton is dense, giving an analytic approach to MPS approximation of ground states anywhere in the class. In this paper, we partially expose the skeleton in certain interacting spin chains: the $N$-state Onsager-integrable chiral clock families. We construct MPS that form a dense MPS skeleton in the gapped regions surrounding a sequence of fixed-point Hamiltonians (the generators of the Onsager algebra). Outside these gapped regions, these MPS remain eigenstates, but no longer give the many-body ground state. Rather, they are ground states in particular sectors of the spectrum. Our methods also allow us to find further MPS eigenstates; these correspond to low-lying excited states within the aforementioned gapped regions. This set of MPS excited states goes beyond the previous analysis of ground states on the $N=2$ free-fermion MPS skeleton. As an application of our results, we find a closed form for the disorder parameter in a family of interacting models.

Consequently, they lack an inherent incentive to compress history into compact latent states with consistent transition rules. This often leads to learning solutions that generalize poorly. We introduce Next-Latent Prediction (NextLat), which extends standard next-token training with self-supervised predictions in the latent space. Specifically, NextLat trains a transformer to learn latent representations that are predictive of its next latent state given the next output token. Theoretically, we show that these latents provably converge to belief states, compressed information of the history necessary to predict the future. This simple auxiliary objective also injects a recurrent inductive bias into transformers, while leaving their architecture, parallel training, and inference unchanged. NextLat effectively encourages the transformer to form compact internal world models with its own belief states and transition dynamics -- a crucial property absent in standard next-token prediction transformers. Empirically, across benchmarks targeting core sequence modeling competencies -- world modeling, reasoning, planning, and language modeling -- NextLat demonstrates significant gains over standard next-token training in downstream accuracy, representation compression, and lookahead planning.

Accurate localization of the AP is critical for planning and guiding catheter ablation procedures. While traditional diagnostic tree (DT) methods and more recent machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to predict AP location from surface electrocardiogram (ECG), they are often constrained by limited anatomical localization resolution, poor interpretability, and the use of small clinical datasets. In this study, we present a Deep Learning (DL) model for the localization of single manifest APs across 24 cardiac regions, trained on a large, physiologically realistic database of synthetic ECGs generated using a personalized virtual heart model. We also integrate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM, into the pipeline. This enables interpretation of DL decision-making and addresses one of the main barriers to clinical adoption: lack of transparency in ML predictions. Our model achieves localization accuracy above 95%, with a sensitivity of 94.32% and specificity of 99.78%. XAI outputs are physiologically validated against known depolarization patterns, and a novel index is introduced to identify the most informative ECG leads for AP localization. Results highlight lead V2 as the most critical, followed by aVF, V1, and aVL.

Resolving anomalies such as inference performance degradation or latency jitter in distributed system demands significant manual efforts from domain experts, resulting in extremely time-consuming diagnosis processes with relatively low accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Kunlun Anomaly Troubleshooter (KAT), the first anomaly troubleshooting framework tailored for LMDI. KAT addresses this problem through two core innovations. First, KAT exploits the synchronicity and consistency of GPU workers, innovatively leverages function trace data to precisely detect kernel-level anomalies and associated hardware components at nanosecond resolution. Second, KAT integrates these detection results into a domain-adapted LLM, delivering systematic causal reasoning and natural language interpretation of complex anomaly symptoms.

We define the difference between the minimum daemonic ergotropy and the maximum ergotropy of the battery as the daemonic gap at the time where the ergotropy of the battery is maximum. Considering a harmonic mode as the battery and a qubit as the auxiliary charger interacting via Jaynes-Cummings interaction, we show that the daemonic gap can be closed for specific initial passive states of the battery, including the ground state, truncated mixtures of low-lying states, and canonical thermal states. We further define the daemonic band as the difference between the maximum and the minimum daemonic ergotropy, and show that starting from the ground state of the single-mode battery, the daemonic band collapses. We also show that achieving a complete charging, along with accessing the full daemonic band, is possible for the single-mode battery using all of the other initial states by repeating the charging cycle and maximizing ergotropy in every round.

We conduct extensive univariate experiments across 33 out-of-domain datasets (approximately 1.3M imputation windows) and evaluate their ability to integrate covariates at inference time to improve accuracy without fine-tuning.

However, their limited gate count, large feature sizes, and high static power consumption make on-body machine learning classification highly challenging. While existing bendable RISC-V systems provide compact solutions, they lack the energy efficiency required. We present a mechanically flexible RISC-V that integrates a bespoke multiply-accumulate co-processor with fixed coefficients to maximize energy efficiency and minimize latency. Our approach formulates a constrained programming problem to jointly determine co-processor constants and optimally map Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) inference operations, enabling compact, model-specific hardware by leveraging the low fabrication and non-recurring engineering costs of flexible technologies. Post-layout results demonstrate near-real-time performance across several healthcare datasets, with our circuits operating within the power budget of existing flexible batteries and occupying only 2.42 mm^2, offering a promising path toward accessible, sustainable, and conformable healthcare wearables.

Our protocol only requires single-qubit Pauli measurements together with efficient classical post-processing, and has efficient sample complexity in both the independent (i.i.d.) and adversarial (non-i.i.d.) settings. This fills a key gap between Pauli-based certification schemes for stabilizer or (hyper)graph states and general protocols demanding non-Pauli measurements or classically intractable information about the target state.

The core of MoSKA is a novel Shared KV Attention mechanism that transforms the attention on shared data from a series of memory-bound GEMV operations into a single, compute-bound GEMM by batching concurrent requests. This is supported by an MoE-inspired sparse attention strategy that prunes the search space and a tailored Disaggregated Infrastructure that specializes hardware for unique and shared data.

While existing KV compression methods primarily focus on reducing prefill memory from long input sequences, they fall short in addressing the dynamic and layer-sensitive nature of long-form generation, which is central to reasoning tasks. We propose Lethe, a dynamic KV cache management framework that introduces adaptivity along both the spatial and temporal dimensions of decoding. Along the spatial dimension, Lethe performs layerwise sparsity-aware allocation, assigning token pruning budgets to each transformer layer based on estimated attention redundancy. Along the temporal dimension, Lethe conducts multi-round token pruning during generation, driven by a Recency-Aware Selective Retention} (RASR) mechanism. RASR extends traditional recency-based heuristics by also considering token relevance derived from evolving attention patterns, enabling informed decisions about which tokens to retain or evict.

The effect of decoherence is analysed by studying the evolution of Stratonovich-Weyl quasiprobability distributions on the state-space of the system. It is shown that decoherence makes an arbitrary-given quasiprobability distribution manifestly positive, thus modelling the emergence of classicality in some sense. The decoherence timescale, the minimum time that quasiprobability distributions of every initial state of the system become nonnegative, is shown to decrease in Hilbert-space dimension, and hence larger quantum systems decohere faster.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8be6\u7ec6\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7531\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\uff08\u800c\u975e\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\uff09\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u7b49\u6548\u8868\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u7b97\u5b50\u503c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5c42\u6790\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eceLindblad\u65b9\u7a0b\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5c55\u5f00\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0aStratonovich-Weyl\u51c6\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u5206\u6790\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u51c6\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53d8\u5f97\u660e\u663e\u6b63\u5b9a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u67d0\u79cd\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u7b49\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u91cd\u590d\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u7b97\u5b50\u503c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5c42\u6790\u6d4b\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09\u4eceLindblad\u65b9\u7a0b\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5c55\u5f00\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Stratonovich-Weyl\u51c6\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u4f7f\u5f97\u4efb\u610f\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u51c6\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5f97\u660e\u663e\u6b63\u5b9a\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff08\u5373\u7cfb\u7edf\u6240\u6709\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u51c6\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u4e3a\u975e\u8d1f\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u968f\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\uff0c\u4f7f\u51c6\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5f97\u6b63\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u5230\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff0c\u5927\u7cfb\u7edf\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u66f4\u5feb\u3002"}}

However, most existing MTPP models rely on channel-mixing strategies that encode information from different event types into a single, fixed-size latent representation. This entanglement can obscure type-specific dynamics, leading to performance degradation and increased risk of overfitting. In this work, we introduce ITPP, a novel channel-independent architecture for MTPP modeling that decouples event type information using an encoder-decoder framework with an ODE-based backbone. Central to ITPP is a type-aware inverted self-attention mechanism, designed to explicitly model inter-channel correlations among heterogeneous event types. This architecture enhances effectiveness and robustness while reducing overfitting.

In this work, we extend QAOA-GPT to Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) problems, focusing on spin-glass Hamiltonians that include cubic interaction terms. Using FEATHER graph embeddings to encode topological information, we train the model on graph-circuit pairs generated via ADAPT-QAOA and evaluate its performance on 8- and 16-qubit instances embedded on heavy-hex lattices. The generative model produces adaptive QAOA-like circuits and corresponding variational parameters in a single forward pass, bypassing the iterative classical optimization loop. The generated circuits achieve average approximation ratios exceeding 0.95, closely matching classically optimized ADAPT-QAOA results, while maintaining consistent parameter distributions across circuit depths.

It helps extract features from embedded vectors by adding global information and its expressivity has been proved to be powerful. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity restricts its practicability. Although several researches have provided attention mechanism in sparse form, they are lack of theoretical analysis about the expressivity of their mechanism while reducing complexity. In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity. Other than this, it can be implemented in parallel on a new dimension, which contributes to much memory saving. (2) Random Batch Attention mechanism can improve most of the existing models by replacing their attention mechanisms, even many previously improved attention mechanisms.

In this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack on tabular data, which is particularly challenging due to the presence of both numerical and categorical features. Our key idea is a novel technique to convert categorical values into floating-point representations. This approach preserves enough information to maintain clean-model accuracy compared to traditional methods like one-hot or ordinal encoding. By doing this, we create a gradient-based universal perturbation that applies to all features, including categorical ones.\n  We evaluate our method on five datasets and four popular models. Our results show up to a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box settings (including real-world applications like Vertex AI), revealing a severe vulnerability for tabular data. Our method is shown to surpass the previous works like Tabdoor in terms of performance, while remaining stealthy against state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. We evaluate our attack against Spectral Signatures, Neural Cleanse, Beatrix, and Fine-Pruning, all of which fail to defend successfully against it.

We present an end-to-end system that scales long-sequence modeling to 10k-length histories in production. First, we introduce Stacked Target-to-History Cross Attention (STCA), which replaces history self-attention with stacked cross-attention from the target to the history, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length and enabling efficient end-to-end training. Second, we propose Request Level Batching (RLB), a user-centric batching scheme that aggregates multiple targets for the same user/request to share the user-side encoding, substantially lowering sequence-related storage, communication, and compute without changing the learning objective. Third, we design a length-extrapolative training strategy -- train on shorter windows, infer on much longer ones -- so the model generalizes to 10k histories without additional training cost. Across offline and online experiments, we observe predictable, monotonic gains as we scale history length and model capacity, mirroring the scaling law behavior observed in large language models.

Traditional surrogate modeling approaches often incur high energy consumption, which severely limits their scalability and deployability in resource-constrained environments. We introduce NeuroPOL, \\textit{the first neuroscience-inspired physics-informed operator learning framework} for reliability analysis. NeuroPOL incorporates Variable Spiking Neurons into a physics-informed operator architecture, replacing continuous activations with event-driven spiking dynamics. This innovation promotes sparse communication, significantly reduces computational load, and enables an energy-efficient surrogate model. The proposed framework lowers both computational and power demands, supporting real-time reliability assessment and deployment on edge devices and digital twins. By embedding governing physical laws into operator learning, NeuroPOL builds physics-consistent surrogates capable of accurate uncertainty propagation and efficient failure probability estimation, even for high-dimensional problems. We evaluate NeuroPOL on five canonical benchmarks, the Burgers equation, Nagumo equation, two-dimensional Poisson equation, two-dimensional Darcy equation, and incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with energy coupling. Results show that NeuroPOL achieves reliability measures comparable to standard physics-informed operators, while introducing significant communication sparsity, enabling scalable, distributed, and energy-efficient deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroPOL\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53d8\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u66ff\u4ee3\u8fde\u7eed\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u6548\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u53d8\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7b97\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u66ff\u4ee3\u8fde\u7eed\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cNeuroPOL\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7b97\u5b50\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuroPOL\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u529f\u8017\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, we refine tasks when conflicts with actual observations are detected, mitigating hallucinations while maintaining task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with a global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment.

A popular solution is sub-model training, where the server only distributes randomly sampled sub-models to the edge clients, and clients only update these small models. However, those random sampling of sub-models may not give satisfying convergence performance. In this paper, observing the success of SGD with shuffling, we propose a distributed shuffled sub-model training, where the full model is partitioned into several sub-models in advance, and the server shuffles those sub-models, sends each of them to clients at each round, and by the end of local updating period, clients send back the updated sub-models, and server averages them. We establish the convergence rate of this algorithm. We also study the generalization of distributed sub-model training via stability analysis, and find that the sub-model training can improve the generalization via amplifying the stability of training process. The extensive experiments also validate our theoretical findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6df7\u6d17\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5148\u5212\u5206\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6df7\u6d17\u5e76\u5206\u53d1\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7ed9\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u5148\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6bcf\u8f6e\u6df7\u6d17\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5206\u53d1\u7ed9\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u66f4\u65b0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8fd4\u56de\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6539\u5584\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6df7\u6d17\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Traditionally, relational data has been a source of various insights, but with the increase in computational power and the need to understand deeper relationships between entities, the need to design new techniques has arisen. For this graph data analysis has become an extraordinary tool for understanding the data, which reveals more realistic and flexible modelling of complex relationships. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, drug discovery, and more. However, many adversarial attacks can happen over the data, whether during training (poisoning attack) or during testing (evasion attack), which can adversely manipulate the desired outcome from the GNN model. Therefore, it is crucial to make the GNNs robust to such attacks. The existing robustness methods are computationally demanding and perform poorly when the intensity of attack increases. This paper presents a computationally efficient framework, namely, pLAPGNN, based on weighted p-Laplacian for making GNNs robust.

The limited success of traditional deep learning in tabular knowledge transfer can be advanced by leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, the efficacy of LLMs often stagnates for mixed data types structured in tables due to the limitations of text prompts and in-context learning. We propose a lightweight transfer learning framework that fine-tunes an LLM using source tabular data and transplants the LLM's selective $key$ and $value$ projection weights into a gated feature tokenized transformer (gFTT) built for tabular data. The gFTT model with cross-domain attention is fine-tuned using target tabular data for transfer learning, eliminating the need for shared features, LLM prompt engineering, and large-scale pretrained models. Our experiments using ten pairs of source-target data sets and 12 baselines demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LLM-attention transplant for transfer learning (LATTLE) method over traditional ML models, state-of-the-art deep tabular architectures, and transfer learning models trained on thousands to billions of tabular samples.

Prior work has established that $O(d \\log n)$ samples are sufficient for this task. However, an important factor that is often overlooked in these analyses is the dependence on the condition number of the covariance matrix of the model. Indeed, all algorithms from prior work require a number of samples that grows polynomially with this condition number. In many cases this is unsatisfactory, since the condition number could grow polynomially with $n$, rendering these prior approaches impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we provide an algorithm that recovers the underlying graph and prove that the number of samples required is independent of the condition number. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds that nearly match the upper bound up to a $d$-factor, thus providing an almost tight characterization of the true sample complexity of the problem. Moreover, under a further assumption that all the variances of the variables are bounded, we design a polynomial-time algorithm that recovers the underlying graph, at the cost of an additional polynomial dependence of the sample complexity on $d$.

Existing methods proposed to handle noisy clients assume that a sufficient number of clients with clean labels are available, which can be leveraged to learn a robust global model while dampening the impact of noisy clients. This assumption fails when a high number of heterogeneous clients contain noisy labels, making the existing approaches ineffective. In such scenarios, it is important to locally regularize the clients before communication with the global model, to ensure the global model isn't corrupted by noisy clients. While pre-trained self-supervised models can be effective for local regularization, existing centralized approaches relying on pretrained initialization are impractical in a federated setting due to the potentially large size of these models, which increases communication costs. In that line, we propose a regularization objective for client models that decouples the pre-trained and classification models by enforcing similarity between close data points within the client. We leverage the representation space of a self-supervised pretrained model to evaluate the closeness among examples. This regularization, when applied with the standard objective function for the downstream task in standard noisy federated settings, significantly improves performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art federated methods in multiple computer vision and medical image classification benchmarks. Unlike other techniques that rely on self-supervised pretrained initialization, our method does not require the pretrained model and classifier backbone to share the same architecture, making it architecture-agnostic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u65b0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u566a\u58f0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6c61\u67d3\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u591a\u5e72\u51c0\u6807\u7b7e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5305\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u65f6\u5931\u6548\u3002\u9700\u8981\u672c\u5730\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u566a\u58f0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6c61\u67d3\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5185\u76f8\u8fd1\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u63a5\u8fd1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u566a\u58f0\u8054\u90a6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u51c6\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8981\u6c42\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e3b\u5e72\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u540c\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u5177\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Accurate and timely inference of supply chain resilience the capability to maintain core functions during disruptions is crucial for proactive risk mitigation and robust network design. However, existing approaches lack effective mechanisms to infer supply chain resilience without explicit system dynamics and struggle to represent the higher-order, multi-entity dependencies inherent in supply chain networks. These limitations motivate the definition of a novel problem and the development of targeted modeling solutions. To address these challenges, we formalize a novel problem: Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI), defined as predicting supply chain resilience using hypergraph topology and observed inventory trajectories without explicit dynamic equations. To solve this problem, we propose the Supply Chain Resilience Inference Hypergraph Network (SC-RIHN), a novel hypergraph-based model leveraging set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to capture multi-party firm-product interactions.

Here, we are given as input a design matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ and measurements or labels ${y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ where ${y} = {X} {w}^* + \u03be$, and $\u03be$ is the noise in the measurements. Importantly, we have the additional constraint that the unknown signal vector ${w}^*$ is sparse: it has $k$ non-zero entries where $k$ is much smaller than the ambient dimension. Our goal is to output a prediction vector $\\widehat{w}$ that has small prediction error: $\\frac{1}{N}\\cdot \\|{X} {w}^* - {X} \\widehat{w}\\|^2_2$.\n  Information-theoretically, we know what is best possible in terms of measurements: under most natural noise distributions, we can get prediction error at most $\u03b5$ with roughly $N = O(k \\log d/\u03b5)$ samples. Computationally, this currently needs $d^{\u03a9(k)}$ run-time. Alternately, with $N = O(d)$, we can get polynomial-time. Thus, there is an exponential gap (in the dependence on $d$) between the two and we do not know if it is possible to get $d^{o(k)}$ run-time and $o(d)$ samples.\n  We give the first generic positive result for worst-case design matrices ${X}$: For any ${X}$, we show that if the support of ${w}^*$ is chosen at random, we can get prediction error $\u03b5$ with $N = \\text{poly}(k, \\log d, 1/\u03b5)$ samples and run-time $\\text{poly}(d,N)$. This run-time holds for any design matrix ${X}$ with condition number up to $2^{\\text{poly}(d)}$.\n  Previously, such results were known for worst-case ${w}^*$, but only for random design matrices from well-behaved families, matrices that have a very low condition number ($\\text{poly}(\\log d)$; e.g., as studied in compressed sensing), or those with special structural properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u6b63\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635X\uff0c\u5f53\u7a00\u758f\u4fe1\u53f7w*\u7684\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c0f\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u9700\u8981O(k log d/\u03b5)\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u9700\u8981d^\u03a9(k)\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u9700\u8981O(d)\u6837\u672c\u624d\u80fd\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u6216\u7279\u6b8a\u7ed3\u6784\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635X\uff0c\u5f53\u7a00\u758f\u4fe1\u53f7w*\u7684\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528poly(k, log d, 1/\u03b5)\u6837\u672c\u548cpoly(d,N)\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1w*\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u9ad8\u8fbe2^poly(d)\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u7a00\u758f\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u03b5\uff0c\u6240\u9700\u6837\u672c\u6570\u4e3apoly(k, log d, 1/\u03b5)\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3apoly(d,N)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6307\u6570\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u77e9\u9635\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

By varying the fractional derivative order $\u03b1\\in (0,1]$, our encoders produce a continuous spectrum of views: small $\u03b1$ yields localized features, while large $\u03b1$ induces broader, global aggregation. We treat $\u03b1$ as a learnable parameter so the model can adapt diffusion scales to the data and automatically discover informative views.

The fundamental challenge of the DODE problem in microscopic simulations stems from the complex temporal dynamics and inherent uncertainty of individual vehicle dynamics. This makes it highly challenging to precisely determine which vehicle traverses which link at any given moment, resulting in intricate and often ambiguous relationships between origin-destination (OD) matrices and their contributions to resultant link flows. This phenomenon constitutes the credit assignment problem, a central challenge addressed in this study. We formulate the DODE problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel framework that applies model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Within our proposed framework, the agent learns an optimal policy to sequentially generate OD matrices, refining its strategy through direct interaction with the simulation environment. The proposed method is validated on the Nguyen-Dupuis network using SUMO, where its performance is evaluated against ground-truth link flows aggregated at 5-minute intervals over a 30-minute horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 43.2% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to the best-performing conventional baseline.

While substantial progress has been made in affective computing, most emotion recognition systems rely on cloud-based inference, introducing privacy vulnerabilities and latency constraints unsuitable for real-time applications. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning architectures for on-device emotion recognition from wrist-based photoplethysmography (PPG), systematically comparing different models spanning classical ensemble methods, deep neural networks, and transformers on the WESAD stress detection dataset. Results demonstrate that classical ensemble methods substantially outperform deep learning on small physiological datasets, with ExtraTrees achieving F1 = 0.826 on combined features and F1 = 0.623 on wrist-only features, compared to transformers achieving only F1 = 0.509-0.577. We deploy the wrist-only ExtraTrees model optimized via ONNX conversion, achieving a 4.08 MB footprint, 0.05 ms inference latency, and 152x speedup over the original implementation. Furthermore, ONNX optimization yields a 30.5% average storage reduction and 40.1x inference speedup, highlighting the feasibility of privacy-preserving on-device emotion recognition for real-world wearables.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u624b\u8155PPG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ONNX\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e91\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5728WESAD\u538b\u529b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u8155\u5149\u7535\u5bb9\u79ef\u8109\u640f\u6ce2(PPG)\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ONNX\u8f6c\u6362\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "ExtraTrees\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u4e0aF1=0.826\uff0c\u4ec5\u624b\u8155\u7279\u5f81\u4e0aF1=0.623\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eTransformer\u7684F1=0.509-0.577\u3002ONNX\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f4.08MB\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf0.05ms\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347152\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ONNX\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Our analysis establishes that ICL performance follows power-law relationships with model depth $L$, width $d$, context length $k$, and training data $D$, with exponents determined by task structure. We show that under specific conditions, transformers implement gradient-based metalearning in their forward pass, with an effective learning rate $\u03b7_{\\text{eff}} = \u0398(1/\\sqrt{Ld})$. We demonstrate sharp phase transitions at critical scales and derive optimal depth-width allocations favoring $L^* \\propto N^{2/3}$, $d^* \\propto N^{1/3}$ for the fixed parameter budget $N = Ld$.

While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become a standard for this, they face a fundamental dilemma in continual learning. Reusing a single set of PEFT parameters for new tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, allocating distinct parameters for each task prevents forgetting but results in a linear growth of the model's size and fails to facilitate knowledge transfer between related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive PEFT method referred to as \\textit{Mixtures of SubExperts (MoSEs)}, a novel continual learning framework designed for minimal forgetting and efficient scalability. MoSEs integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into the transformer layers, governed by a task-specific routing mechanism. This architecture allows the model to isolate and protect knowledge within dedicated SubExperts, thereby minimizing parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, the router can adaptively select and combine previously learned sparse parameters for new tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer while ensuring that the model's capacity grows sublinearly. We evaluate MoSEs on the comprehensive TRACE benchmark datasets.

However, such models suffer from approximation errors introduced by efficiency techniques, which significantly degrade generation quality. Once deployed, these errors are difficult to correct, as modifying the model is typically infeasible in deployment environments. Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output.

To address these limitations, we propose GLMR, a Generative Language Model-based Retrieval framework that mitigates the cross-modal misalignment through a two-stage process. In the pre-retrieval stage, a contrastive learning-based model identifies top candidate molecules as contextual priors for the input mass spectrum. In the generative retrieval stage, these candidate molecules are integrated with the input mass spectrum to guide a generative model in producing refined molecular structures, which are then used to re-rank the candidates based on molecular similarity.

For efficient deployment of these algorithms, although different techniques for the compression of neural network models are proposed, neural pruning is one of the fastest and effective methods, which can provide a high compression gain with minimal cost. To harness enhanced performance gain with respect to model complexity, we propose a novel neural network pruning approach utilizing Hessian-vector products that approximate crucial curvature information in the loss function, which significantly reduces the computation demands. By employing a power iteration method, our algorithm effectively identifies and preserves the essential information, ensuring a balanced trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency. Herein, we introduce CAMP-HiVe, a cyclic pair merging-based pruning with Hessian Vector approximation by iteratively consolidating weight pairs, combining significant and less significant weights, thus effectively streamlining the model while preserving its performance. This dynamic, adaptive framework allows for real-time adjustment of weight significance, ensuring that only the most critical parameters are retained. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant reductions in computational requirements while maintaining high performance across different neural network architectures, e.g., ResNet18, ResNet56, and MobileNetv2, on standard benchmark datasets, e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, and it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art neural pruning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eHessian\u5411\u91cf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5CAMP-HiVe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u914d\u5bf9\u5408\u5e76\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u526a\u679d\u662f\u6700\u5feb\u901f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Hessian\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u79ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e42\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u914d\u5bf9\u5408\u5e76\u6743\u91cd\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u8981\u548c\u4e0d\u91cd\u8981\u6743\u91cd\uff09\u6765\u7cbe\u7b80\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728ResNet18\u3001ResNet56\u3001MobileNetv2\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u548cCIFAR10\u3001CIFAR-100\u3001ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CAMP-HiVe\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

LLM$^3$-DTI constructs multi-modal data embedding to enhance DTI prediction performance. In this framework, the text semantic embeddings of drugs and targets are encoded by a domain-specific LLM. To effectively align and fuse multi-modal embedding. We propose the dual cross-attention mechanism and the TSFusion module. Finally, these multi-modal data are utilized for the DTI task through an output network. The experimental results indicate that LLM$^3$-DTI can proficiently identify validated DTIs, surpassing the performance of the models employed for comparison across diverse scenarios. Consequently, LLM$^3$-DTI is adept at fulfilling the task of DTI prediction with excellence.

This design is specifically tailored to effectively capture chaotic dynamics and improve responsiveness during periods of heightened volatility, where conventional activation functions (e.g., ReLU, GELU) tend to saturate. Furthermore, COTN incorporates an Autoencoder Self-Regressive (ASR) module to detect and isolate abnormal market patterns, such as sudden price spikes or crashes, thereby preventing corruption of the core prediction process and enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments across electricity spot markets and financial markets demonstrate the practical applicability and resilience of COTN. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models like Informer by up to 17% and traditional statistical methods like GARCH by as much as 40%.

Physics-Attention projects grid points into slices for slice attention, then maps them back through deslicing. However, we observe that Physics-Attention can be reformulated as a special case of linear attention, and that the slice attention may even hurt the model performance. Based on these observations, we argue that its effectiveness primarily arises from the slice and deslice operations rather than interactions between slices. Building on this insight, we propose a two-step transformation to redesign Physics-Attention into a canonical linear attention, which we call Linear Attention Neural Operator (LinearNO).

The growing availability of 3D geospatial data from multiple modalities has introduced new opportunities and challenges for integrating spatial knowledge at scale, particularly in high-impact domains such as urban planning and rapid disaster management. Geospatial entity resolution is the task of identifying matching spatial objects across different datasets, often collected independently under varying conditions. Existing approaches typically rely on spatial proximity, textual metadata, or external identifiers to determine correspondence. While useful, these signals are often unavailable, unreliable, or misaligned, especially in cross-source scenarios. To address these limitations, we shift the focus to the intrinsic geometry of 3D spatial objects and present 3dSAGER (3D Spatial-Aware Geospatial Entity Resolution), an end-to-end pipeline for geospatial entity resolution over 3D objects. 3dSAGER introduces a novel, spatial-reference-independent featurization mechanism that captures intricate geometric characteristics of matching pairs, enabling robust comparison even across datasets with incompatible coordinate systems where traditional spatial methods fail.

Over these 15 years, it has grown from a purely competition-focused site into a broader ecosystem with forums, notebooks, models, datasets, and more. With the release of the Kaggle Meta Code and Kaggle Meta Datasets, we now have a unique opportunity to explore these competitions, technologies, and real-world applications of Machine Learning and AI. And so in this study, we take a closer look at 15 years of data science on Kaggle - through metadata, shared code, community discussions, and the competitions themselves. We explore Kaggle's growth, its impact on the data science community, uncover hidden technological trends, analyze competition winners, how Kagglers approach problems in general, and more. We do this by analyzing millions of kernels and discussion threads to perform both longitudinal trend analysis and standard exploratory data analysis. Our findings show that Kaggle is a steadily growing platform with increasingly diverse use cases, and that Kagglers are quick to adapt to new trends and apply them to real-world challenges, while producing - on average - models with solid generalization capabilities. We also offer a snapshot of the platform as a whole, highlighting its history and technological evolution.

Nevertheless, advances are dominated by mathematics (e.g., AIME), with competitive-programming code generation underexplored and data curation receiving less attention than RL algorithm design. We investigate how to construct RLVR datasets (i.e., RL prompts) and present practical training techniques that yield strong performance on competitive-programming code generation. Our pipeline begins with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) distilled from strong open-source models, augmented with general-purpose and reasoning-intensive data. RL then follows a two-stage process with executable, testcase-driven rewards: first, training on a large, uniformly distributed set of competitive-programming problems using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with 8 rollouts per prompt and a relatively short response-generation window (e.g., 32k during SFT and 24k in this stage) to expand entropy and mitigate repetition and truncation; second, we perform \\textbf{Pre-GRPO}: updating on a small, high-quality set of challenging problems with a large rollout budget (64 rollouts per prompt) under a hard-focus curriculum that continuously retains the most difficult instances throughout training. We implement our method on Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate on LeetCode and Codeforces weekly contests to avoid data leakage. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of similar scale and is comparable to leading systems such as DeepSeek v3.1 and Doubao-1.5-Thinking. We also examine scaling trends and observe strong RL scaling on an internal large-scale MoE model.

Recently, CBFs represented as neural networks have shown great promise due to their expressiveness and applicability to a broad class of dynamics and safety constraints. However, verifying that a trained neural network is indeed a valid CBF is a computational bottleneck that limits the size of the networks that can be used. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework for verifying neural CBFs based on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds on the conditions required for a neural network to be a CBF. Our approach is rooted in linear bound propagation (LBP) for neural networks, which we extend to compute bounds on the gradients of the network. Combined with McCormick relaxation, we derive linear upper and lower bounds on the CBF conditions, thereby eliminating the need for computationally expensive verification procedures. Our approach applies to arbitrary control-affine systems and a broad range of nonlinear activation functions. To reduce conservatism, we develop a parallelizable refinement strategy that adaptively refines the regions over which these bounds are computed. Our approach scales to larger neural networks than state-of-the-art verification procedures for CBFs, as demonstrated by our numerical experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u4f20\u64ad\u548cMcCormick\u677e\u5f1b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcCBFs\u5177\u6709\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u3001\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5e7f\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u4f20\u64ad\u8ba1\u7b97\u7f51\u7edc\u68af\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408McCormick\u677e\u5f1b\u63a8\u5bfcCBF\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec6\u5316\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u63a7\u5236\u4eff\u5c04\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcCBFs\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898"}}

These shortcomings lead to inconsistent predictions and poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReaDISH, a novel reaction prediction model that learns permutation-invariant representations while incorporating interaction-aware features.

Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($\u03b5$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\\% reduction in communication overhead.

TTRL leverages an elegant two-phase sampling strategy: first, multi-sampling derives a pseudo-label via majority voting, while subsequent downsampling and reward-based fine-tuning encourages the model to explore and learn diverse valid solutions, with the pseudo-label modulating the reward signal. Meanwhile, in-context learning has been widely explored at inference time and demonstrated the ability to enhance model performance without weight updates. However, TTRL's two-phase sampling strategy under-utilizes contextual guidance, which can potentially improve pseudo-label accuracy in the initial exploitation phase while regulating exploration in the second. To address this, we propose context-guided TTRL (CG-TTRL), integrating context dynamically into both sampling phases and propose a method for efficient context selection for on-device applications. Our evaluations on mathematical and scientific QA benchmarks show CG-TTRL outperforms TTRL (e.g. additional 7% relative accuracy improvement over TTRL), while boosting efficiency by obtaining strong performance after only a few steps of test-time training (e.g. 8% relative improvement rather than 1% over TTRL after 3 steps).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CG-TTRL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728TTRL\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u8c03\u8282\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u79d1\u5b66QA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eTTRL\u3002", "motivation": "TTRL\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5df2\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6307\u5bfc\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u521d\u59cb\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8c03\u8282\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCG-TTRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u79d1\u5b66QA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCG-TTRL\u4f18\u4e8eTTRL\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53477%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4ec5\u51e0\u6b65\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u83b7\u5f97\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\uff083\u6b65\u540e\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u53478%\uff0c\u800cTTRL\u4ec51%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684TTRL\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we propose Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation (C3E), a novel framework that formulates the selection of hidden dimensions and depth as a nonlinear programming problem grounded in information theory. Through modeling spectral graph neural networks as communication channels, our approach directly connects channel capacity to hidden dimensions, propagation depth, propagation mechanism, and graph structure. Extensive experiments on nine public datasets demonstrate that hidden dimensions and depths estimated by C3E can mitigate over-squashing and consistently improve representation learning. Experimental results show that over-squashing occurs due to the cumulative compression of information in representation matrices. Furthermore, our findings show that increasing hidden dimensions indeed mitigate information compression, while the role of propagation depth is more nuanced, uncovering a fundamental balance between information compression and representation complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86C3E\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u6df1\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u64ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff08\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8c31\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u9053\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u4f20\u64ad\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u57289\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cC3E\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u589e\u52a0\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u64ad\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u66f4\u4e3a\u5fae\u5999\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Current fusion methods are typically evaluated on a small selection of public datasets, a limited scope that inadequately represents the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios, potentially leading to biased evaluations. This issue presents a twofold challenge. On one hand, models may overfit to the biases of specific datasets, hindering their generalization to broader practical applications. On the other hand, the absence of a unified evaluation standard makes fair and objective comparisons between different fusion methods difficult. Consequently, a truly universal and high-performance fusion model has yet to emerge. To address these challenges, we have developed a large-scale, domain-adaptive benchmark for multimodal evaluation. This benchmark integrates over 30 datasets, encompassing 15 modalities and 20 predictive tasks across key application domains.

Conference version: NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight). Extended appendix included", "summary": "Consider the task of locating an unknown target point using approximate distance queries: in each round, a reconstructor selects a query point and receives a noisy version of its distance to the target. This problem arises naturally in various contexts ranging from localization in GPS and sensor networks to privacy-aware data access, and spans a wide variety of metric spaces. It is relevant from the perspective of both the reconstructor (seeking accurate recovery) and the responder (aiming to limit information disclosure, e.g., for privacy or security reasons). We study this reconstruction game through a learning-theoretic lens, focusing on the rate and limits of the best possible reconstruction error. Our first result provides a tight geometric characterization of the optimal error in terms of the Chebyshev radius, a classical concept from geometry. This characterization applies to all compact metric spaces (in fact, even to all totally bounded spaces) and yields explicit formulas for natural metric spaces. Our second result addresses the asymptotic behavior of reconstruction, distinguishing between pseudo-finite spaces -- where the optimal error is attained after finitely many queries -- and spaces where the approximation curve exhibits nontrivial decay. We characterize pseudo-finiteness for convex Euclidean spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ddd\u79bb\u67e5\u8be2\u5b9a\u4f4d\u672a\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u70b9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6700\u4f18\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86Chebyshev\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e76\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u4f2a\u6709\u9650\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u81ea\u7136\u51fa\u73b0\u5728GPS\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u91cd\u6784\u8005\uff08\u5bfb\u6c42\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\uff09\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u8005\uff08\u9650\u5236\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u6784\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Chebyshev\u534a\u5f84\uff09\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u6700\u4f18\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1a\u6700\u4f18\u8bef\u5dee\u7531Chebyshev\u534a\u5f84\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u7d27\u81f4\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u4f2a\u6709\u9650\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u6709\u9650\u67e5\u8be2\u540e\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\u548c\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u51f8\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4f2a\u6709\u9650\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8ddd\u79bb\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u3002"}}

Our method not only delivers accurate predictions of sepsis onset but also enables clinicians to understand, validate, and align model outputs with established medical expertise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8113\u6bd2\u75c7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8113\u6bd2\u75c7\u53d1\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u8ba9\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5e76\u4e0e\u533b\u5b66\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u8113\u6bd2\u75c7\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5371\u53ca\u751f\u547d\u7684\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u3002\u867d\u7136\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u8113\u6bd2\u75c7\u53d1\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9ed1\u76d2\u6027\u8d28\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684AI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u80fd\u591f\u88ab\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u8113\u6bd2\u75c7\u53d1\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u8113\u6bd2\u75c7\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u533b\u5b66\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

These graph representations may evolve over time, forming time-varying graphs. Effectively modeling and analyzing such dynamic graph data is critical for tasks like predicting graph evolution and reconstructing missing graph data. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the Koopman autoencoder (KAE) to handle time-varying graph data. Specifically, we assume the existence of a hidden non-linear dynamical system, where the state vector corresponds to the graph embedding of the time-varying graph signals. To capture the evolving graph structures, the graph data is first converted into a vector time series through graph embedding, representing the structural information in a finite-dimensional latent space. In this latent space, the KAE is applied to learn the underlying non-linear dynamics governing the temporal evolution of graph features, enabling both prediction and reconstruction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eKoopman\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u53d8\u56fe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u5c06\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5411\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\u5e38\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u5f62\u6210\u65f6\u53d8\u56fe\u3002\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u7c7b\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u56fe\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u7f3a\u5931\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Koopman\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u5c06\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5411\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u53d8\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eKoopman\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u53d8\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

We propose Sequence-level TopK (SeqTopK), a minimal modification that shifts the expert budget from the token level to the sequence level. By selecting the top $T \\cdot K$ experts across all $T$ tokens, SeqTopK enables end-to-end learned dynamic allocation -- assigning more experts to difficult tokens and fewer to easy ones -- while preserving the same overall budget. SeqTopK requires only a few lines of code, adds less than 1% overhead, and remains fully compatible with pretrained MoE models. Experiments across math, coding, law, and writing show consistent improvements over TopK and prior parameter-free adaptive methods, with gains that become substantially larger under higher sparsity (up to 16.9%).

Tensor Network (TN) methods such as the Modified Alternating Linear Scheme (MVMALS) have been a breakthrough for the field, offering a tractable approach by exploiting the low-rank structure in Volterra kernels. However, these techniques still encounter prohibitive computational and memory bottlenecks due to high-order polynomial scaling with respect to input dimension. To overcome this barrier, we introduce the Tensor Head Averaging (THA) algorithm, which significantly reduces complexity by constructing an ensemble of localized MVMALS models trained on small subsets of the input space. In this paper, we present a theoretical foundation for the THA algorithm. We establish observable, finite-sample bounds on the error between the THA ensemble and a full MVMALS model, and we derive an exact decomposition of the squared error. This decomposition is used to analyze the manner in which subset models implicitly compensate for omitted dynamics. We quantify this effect, and prove that correlation between the included and omitted dynamics creates an optimization incentive which drives THA's performance toward accuracy superior to a simple truncation of a full MVMALS model.

However, generating these explanations for multivariate time series presents challenges due to their complex, multi-dimensional nature. Traditional Nearest Unlike Neighbor-based methods typically substitute subsequences in a queried time series with influential subsequences from an NUN, which is not always realistic in real-world scenarios due to the rigid direct substitution. Counterfactual with Residual Generative Adversarial Networks-based methods aim to address this by learning from the distribution of observed data to generate synthetic counterfactual explanations. However, these methods primarily focus on minimizing the cost from the queried time series to the counterfactual explanations and often neglect the importance of distancing the counterfactual explanation from the decision boundary. This oversight can result in explanations that no longer qualify as counterfactual if minor changes occur within the model. To generate a more robust counterfactual explanation, we introduce TriShGAN, under the CounteRGAN framework enhanced by the incorporation of triplet loss. This unsupervised learning approach uses distance metric learning to encourage the counterfactual explanations not only to remain close to the queried time series but also to capture the feature distribution of the instance with the desired outcome, thereby achieving a better balance between minimal cost and robustness. Additionally, we integrate a Shapelet Extractor that strategically selects the most discriminative parts of the high-dimensional queried time series to enhance the sparsity of counterfactual explanation and efficiency of the training process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TriShGAN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728CounteRGAN\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u8861\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Shapelet\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u4e0d\u540c\u90bb\u5c45\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u66ff\u6362\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6210\u672c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u8fdc\u79bb\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8f7b\u5fae\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u5728CounteRGAN\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65e2\u63a5\u8fd1\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u53c8\u6355\u83b7\u671f\u671b\u7ed3\u679c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u96c6\u6210Shapelet\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u6700\u5177\u533a\u5206\u6027\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "TriShGAN\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u635f\u5931\u548cShapelet\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Using vehicle-kinematic time series (e.g., speed, motor RPM), our model attains strong accuracy: RMSE 3.36 +/- 1.10, MAE 2.21 +/- 0.89, R-squared = 0.93 +/- 0.02, explained variance 0.93 +/- 0.02, and delivers well-calibrated uncertainty bands with near-nominal coverage. Against competitive baselines (Student-t MC dropout; quantile regression with/without anchoring), our method matches or improves log-scores while producing sharper intervals at the same coverage.

A critical yet often overlooked barrier lies in the computational and memory limitations of RAN baseband hardware, particularly in legacy 4th Generation (4G) systems, which typically lack on-chip neural accelerators. As a result, only lightweight AI models (under 1 Mb and sub-100~\u03bcs inference time) can be effectively deployed, limiting both their performance and applicability. However, achieving strong generalization across diverse network conditions often requires large-scale models with substantial resource demands. To address this trade-off, this paper investigates policy distillation in the context of a reinforcement learning-based link adaptation task. We explore two strategies: single-policy distillation, where a scenario-agnostic teacher model is compressed into one generalized student model; and multi-policy distillation, where multiple scenario-specific teachers are consolidated into a single generalist student. Experimental evaluations in a high-fidelity, 5th Generation (5G)-compliant simulator demonstrate that both strategies produce compact student models that preserve the teachers' generalization capabilities while complying with the computational and memory limitations of existing RAN hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72AI\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\uff09\u6765\u538b\u7f29\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u5728\u73b0\u67094G/5G\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3RAN\u4e2dAI\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u94fe\u8def\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\uff08<1ms\uff09\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca4G\u786c\u4ef6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u90e8\u7f72\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff08<1Mb\uff0c<100\u03bcs\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f - \u5c06\u573a\u666f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f - \u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u901a\u7528\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f5G\u517c\u5bb9\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u90fd\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u73b0\u6709RAN\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u662f\u89e3\u51b3RAN\u4e2dAI\u90e8\u7f72\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u67094G/5G\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002"}}

Fairness in this setting is critical, as biased predictions can exacerbate societal inequalities. Prior work adopts a dyadic definition of fairness, enforcing fairness through demographic parity between intra-group and inter-group link predictions. However, we show that this dyadic framing can obscure underlying disparities across subgroups, allowing systemic biases to go undetected. Moreover, we argue that demographic parity does not meet desired properties for fairness assessment in ranking-based tasks such as link prediction. We formalize the limitations of existing fairness evaluations and propose a framework that enables a more expressive assessment.

In this work, we contribute to this perspective by proposing novel optimistic online-to-batch conversions that incorporate optimism theoretically into the analysis, thereby significantly simplifying the online algorithm design while preserving the optimal convergence rates. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our conversions through the following results: (i) when combined with simple online gradient descent, our optimistic conversion achieves the optimal accelerated convergence; (ii) our conversion also applies to strongly convex objectives, and by leveraging both optimistic online-to-batch conversion and optimistic online algorithms, we achieve the optimal accelerated convergence rate for strongly convex and smooth objectives, for the first time through the lens of online-to-batch conversion; (iii) our optimistic conversion can achieve universality to smoothness -- applicable to both smooth and non-smooth objectives without requiring knowledge of the smoothness coefficient -- and remains efficient as non-universal methods by using only one gradient query in each iteration.

However, in deep architectures, this process often leads to diminished expressiveness. A popular solution is to use residual connections, where the input from the current (or initial) layer is added to aggregated neighbor information to preserve embeddings across layers. Following a recent line of research, we investigate an adaptive residual scheme in which different nodes have varying residual strengths. We prove that this approach prevents oversmoothing; particularly, we show that the Dirichlet energy of the embeddings remains bounded away from zero. This is the first theoretical guarantee not only for the adaptive setting, but also for static residual connections (where residual strengths are shared across nodes) with activation functions. Furthermore, extensive experiments show that this adaptive approach outperforms standard and state-of-the-art message passing mechanisms, especially on heterophilic graphs. To improve the time complexity of our approach, we introduce a variant in which residual strengths are not learned but instead set heuristically, a choice that performs as well as the learnable version.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b8b\u5dee\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u8282\u70b9\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u90fd\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e38\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b8b\u5dee\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8ba9\u4e0d\u540c\u8282\u70b9\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\uff08\u5d4c\u5165\u7684Dirichlet\u80fd\u91cf\u6709\u4e0b\u754c\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7248\u672c\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7248\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u914d\u56fe\uff08heterophilic graphs\uff09\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7248\u672c\u4e0e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7248\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u4f46\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b8b\u5dee\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u5f02\u914d\u56fe\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e14\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7248\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the effectiveness of traditional GNNs degrades on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different labels or properties. While recent work has introduced mechanisms to improve GNN performance under heterophily, certain key limitations still exist. Most existing models apply a fixed aggregation depth across all nodes, overlooking the fact that nodes may require different propagation depths based on their local homophily levels and neighborhood structures. Moreover, many methods are tailored to either homophilic or heterophilic settings, lacking the flexibility to generalize across both regimes. To address these challenges, we develop a theoretical framework that links local structural and label characteristics to information propagation dynamics at the node level. Our analysis shows that optimal aggregation depth varies across nodes and is critical for preserving class-discriminative information. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel adaptive-depth GNN architecture that dynamically selects node-specific aggregation depths using theoretically grounded metrics. Our method seamlessly adapts to both homophilic and heterophilic patterns within a unified model.

A key challenge, however, is that real-world measurements are often corrupted by noise, which severely degrades the performance of data-driven models. Particularly, in chaotic dynamical systems, where small errors amplify rapidly, it is challenging to identify a data-driven model from noisy data that achieves short-term accuracy while preserving long-term invariant properties. In this paper, we propose the use of the weak formulation as a complementary approach to the classical strong formulation of data-driven time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we focus on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) architecture. Unlike the standard strong formulation, which relies on the discretization of the NODE followed by optimization, the weak formulation constrains the model using a set of integrated residuals over temporal subdomains. While such a formulation yields an effective NODE model, we discover that the performance of a NODE can be further enhanced by employing this weak formulation as a penalty alongside the classical strong formulation-based learning.

Existing data synthesis methods often exacerbate this problem by creating data with symmetric utility, allowing any party to extract its value. This paper introduces the Encapsulation-Forging (EnFo) framework, a novel approach to generate rival synthetic data with asymmetric utility. EnFo operates in two stages: it first encapsulates predictive knowledge from the original data into a designated ``key'' model, and then forges a synthetic dataset by optimizing the data to intentionally overfit this key model. This process transforms non-rival data into a rival product, ensuring its value is accessible only to the intended model, thereby preventing unauthorized use and preserving the data owner's competitive edge. Our framework demonstrates remarkable sample efficiency, matching the original data's performance with a fraction of its size, while providing robust privacy protection and resistance to misuse.

To address these issues, we propose a $\\textbf{D}$ual-branch $\\textbf{S}$patial-$\\textbf{T}$emporal self-supervised representation framework for enhanced road representations, termed as DST.

Besides, DST contrasts road representations of the vanilla road network against that of the hypergraph in a spatial self-supervised way. The hypergraph is newly built based on three types of hyperedges to capture long-range relations. On the other hand, DST performs next token prediction as the temporal self-supervised task on the sequences of traffic dynamics based on a causal Transformer, which is further regularized by differentiating traffic modes of weekdays from those of weekends.

Yet, this task remains highly challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data across different buildings, climate zones, and seasonal patterns. In particular, buildings situated in distinct climatic regions introduce variability that often leads existing methods to overfit to spurious correlations, rely heavily on expert intervention, or compromise on data diversity. To address these limitations, we propose CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model that learns invariant (Markov blanket) representations for robust cross-domain prediction. In a purely data-driven fashion and without requiring any prior knowledge, CaberNet integrates i) a global feature gate trained with a self-supervised Bernoulli regularization to distinguish superior causal features from inferior ones, and ii) a domain-wise training scheme that balances domain contributions, minimizes cross-domain loss variance, and promotes latent factor independence. We evaluate CaberNet on real-world datasets collected from three buildings located in three climatically diverse cities, and it consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving a 22.9\\% reduction in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to the best benchmark.

While transfer learning has been extensively studied in traditional classification, transfer learning in imbalanced classification such as Neyman-Pearson classification has received much less attention. This setting poses unique challenges, as both types of errors must be simultaneously controlled.

Although churn prediction and demand forecasting have been widely studied in B2B contexts, the use of machine learning to guide asset allocation remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a framework focused on predicting which beverage clients are most likely to deliver strong returns in volume after receiving a cooler. Using a private dataset from a well-known Central American brewing and beverage company of 3,119 B2B traditional trade channel clients that received a cooler from 2022-01 to 2024-07, and tracking 12 months of sales transactions before and after cooler installation, three growth thresholds were defined: 10%, 30% and 50% growth in sales volume year over year. The analysis compares results of machine learning models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost combined with SHAP for interpretable feature analysis in order to have insights into improving business operations related to cooler allocation; the results show that the best model has AUC scores of 0.857, 0.877, and 0.898 across the thresholds on the validation set. Simulations suggest that this approach can improve ROI because it better selects potential clients to grow at the expected level and increases cost savings by not assigning clients that will not grow, compared to traditional volume-based approaches with substantial business management recommendations", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u54ea\u4e9b\u996e\u6599\u5ba2\u6237\u5728\u83b7\u5f97\u51b7\u85cf\u5c55\u793a\u67dc\u540e\u6700\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9500\u91cf\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u4ea7\u5206\u914d\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u6d88\u8d39\u54c1\u884c\u4e1a\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u8d44\u4ea7\uff08\u5982\u5546\u7528\u996e\u6599\u51b7\u85cf\u67dc\uff09\u7684\u653e\u7f6e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5ba2\u6237\u6d41\u5931\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u5728B2B\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6307\u5bfc\u8d44\u4ea7\u5206\u914d\u4ecd\u76f8\u5bf9\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u4e2d\u7f8e\u6d32\u77e5\u540d\u917f\u9152\u548c\u996e\u6599\u516c\u53f8\u76843,119\u4e2aB2B\u4f20\u7edf\u8d38\u6613\u6e20\u9053\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u51b7\u85cf\u67dc\u5b89\u88c5\u524d\u540e12\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u9500\u552e\u4ea4\u6613\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e8610%\u300130%\u548c50%\u4e09\u4e2a\u9500\u91cf\u540c\u6bd4\u589e\u957f\u9608\u503c\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86XGBoost\u3001LightGBM\u548cCatBoost\u7b49\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684AUC\u5f97\u5206\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.857\u30010.877\u548c0.898\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u9500\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u589e\u957f\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u4e0d\u4f1a\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u6765\u589e\u52a0\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u4ece\u51b7\u85cf\u67dc\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u5584\u4e1a\u52a1\u8fd0\u8425\u548c\u8d44\u4ea7\u5206\u914d\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Existing models either rely on pharmacologic knowledge graphs (KGs), which fail on unseen drugs, or on electronic health records (EHRs), which are noisy, temporal, and site-dependent. We introduce, to our knowledge, the first system that conditions KG relation scoring on patient-level EHR context and distills that reasoning into an EHR-only model for zero-shot inference. A fusion \"Teacher\" learns mechanism-specific relations for drug pairs represented in both sources, while a distilled \"Student\" generalizes to new or rarely used drugs without KG access at inference. Both operate under a shared ontology (set) of pharmacologic mechanisms (drug relations) to produce interpretable, auditable alerts rather than opaque risk scores. Trained on a multi-institution EHR corpus paired with a curated DrugBank DDI graph, and evaluated using a clinically aligned, decision-focused protocol with leakage-safe negatives that avoid artificially easy pairs, the system maintains precision across multi-institutuion test data, produces mechanism-specific, clinically consistent predictions, reduces false alerts (higher precision) at comparable overall detection performance (F1), and misses fewer true interactions compared to prior methods.

Shengpu Tang and Wei Jin contributed equally as senior authors", "summary": "Accurate predictions of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) can enable effective personalized therapy. While cognitive tests and clinical data are routinely collected, they lack the predictive power of PET scans and CSF biomarker analysis, which are prohibitively expensive to obtain for every patient. To address this cost-accuracy dilemma, we design a two-stage machine learning framework that selectively obtains advanced, costly features based on their predicted \"value of information\". We apply our framework to predict AD progression for MCI patients using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework reduces the need for advanced testing by 20% while achieving a test AUROC of 0.929, comparable to the model that uses both basic and advanced features (AUROC=0.915, p=0.1010).

At each layer, a causal block performs a soft split into causal and non-causal branches, fuses causal evidence across modalities, and progressively removes batch-coupled context to focus on label-relevant structure, thereby limiting shortcut signals and stabilizing layerwise refinement. Across four molecular benchmarks, CLaP consistently improves MAE, MSE, and $R^2$ over competitive baselines. The model also produces atom-level causal saliency maps that highlight substructures responsible for predictions, providing actionable guidance for targeted molecular edits.

Conventional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapters and LoRA, typically break symmetry, making them incompatible with those equivariant architectures. ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches. These results suggest that, in many practical scenarios, modulating channel magnitudes is sufficient to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, pointing toward a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MMEA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6807\u91cf\u95e8\u63a7\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u7279\u5f81\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7b49\u53d8PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982ELoRA\u867d\u7136\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4ecd\u4f1a\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6807\u91cf\u95e8\u63a7\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5f20\u91cf\u9636\u548c\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8c03\u8282\u7279\u5f81\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMMEA\u5c06\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8c03\u8282\u901a\u9053\u5e45\u5ea6\u8db3\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7b49\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u800c\u4e0d\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7b49\u53d8PEFT\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411"}}

Together, these components minimize computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy and compatibility with microcontroller units (MCUs).

In this work, we show that the majority of new capabilities in reasoning models can be elicited by small, single-rank changes to base model parameters, with many of these changes being interpretable. Specifically, we use a rank-1 LoRA to create a minimal parameter adapter for Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct which recovers 73-90% of reasoning-benchmark performance compared to a full parameter finetune. We find that the activations of this LoRA are as interpretable as MLP neurons, and fire for reasoning-specific behaviors.

Moreover, these methods do not take global information into account, which is also crucial for mitigating the over-smoothing problem. To address the aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a Dual Mamba-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (DMbaGCN), which is a novel framework that integrates Mamba into GNNs to address over-smoothing from both local and global perspectives. DMbaGCN consists of two modules: the Local State-Evolution Mamba (LSEMba) for local neighborhood aggregation and utilizing Mamba's selective state space modeling to capture node-specific representation dynamics across layers, and the Global Context-Aware Mamba (GCAMba) that leverages Mamba's global attention capabilities to incorporate global context for each node.

Consequently, leveraging private data within organizations to enhance the performance of large models has emerged as a key challenge. The federated learning paradigm, combined with model fine-tuning techniques, effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters. However,the necessity to process high-dimensional feature spaces results in substantial overall computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose the Implicit Federated In-Context Learning (IFed-ICL) framework. IFed-ICL draws inspiration from federated learning to establish a novel distributed collaborative paradigm, by converting client local context examples into implicit vector representations, it enables distributed collaborative computation during the inference phase and injects model residual streams to enhance model performance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves outstanding performance across multiple text classification tasks. Compared to traditional methods, IFed-ICL avoids the extensive parameter updates required by conventional fine-tuning methods while reducing data transmission and local computation at the client level in federated learning.

Instantiated on telecommunications mathematics (e.g., link budgets, SNR/AMC selection, and power-control feasibility), DTA yields state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on TELEMATH without enabling explicit \"thinking\" modes: 72.45% pass@1, surpassing distilled-only training by +17.65 points and outperforming a strong baseline (Qwen3-32B with thinking enabled) by +2.94 points.

Under edge-like inference settings, DTA improves efficiency by reducing reliance on multi-sample voting and disabling expensive reasoning heuristics, cutting energy per output token by ~42% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode enabled) and end-to-end latency by ~60% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode disabled). These results demonstrate that aligning how solutions are produced enables compact, high-yield supervision that is effective for both accuracy and efficiency, offering a practical recipe for domain adaptation in low-resource verticals beyond telecom.", "AI": {"tldr": "DTA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89e3\u9898\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u7535\u4fe1\u6570\u5b66\u7b49\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728TELEMATH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523072.45%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u84b8\u998f\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u534717.65\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7535\u4fe1\u7b49\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u53d7\u79fb\u52a8/\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u7f18\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "DTA\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5019\u9009\u89e3\uff1bDTA\u9636\u6bb5\u91cd\u5199\u6559\u5e08\u89e3\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u5448\u73b0\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u601d\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u53f7\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728TELEMATH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523072.45%\u7684pass@1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u84b8\u998f\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u534717.65\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u6bd4\u542f\u7528\u4e86\u601d\u8003\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684Qwen3-32B\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53472.94\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea642%\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea660%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0cDTA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A common technique in VAE-based collaborative filtering (CF) consists in applying binary input masking to user interaction vectors, which improves performance but remains underexplored theoretically. In this work, we analyze how collaboration arises in VAE-based CF and show it is governed by latent proximity: we derive a latent sharing radius that informs when an SGD update on one user strictly reduces the loss on another user, with influence decaying as the latent Wasserstein distance increases. We further study the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE-based CF primarily exploits \\emph{local} collaboration between input-similar users and under-utilizes global collaboration between far-but-related users. We compare two mechanisms that encourage \\emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade-offs: (1) $\u03b2$-KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck, promoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large; (2) input masking induces stochastic geometric contractions and expansions, which can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also introduce neighborhood drift. To preserve user identity while enabling global consistency, we propose an anchor regularizer that aligns user posteriors with item embeddings, stabilizing users under masking and facilitating signal sharing across related items.

Most existing methods rely heavily on long and continuous EEG recordings, which poses significant challenges for data acquisition in resource-constrained systems, such as wearable or home-based monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose the task of resource-efficient sleep staging, which aims to reduce the amount of signal collected per sleep epoch while maintaining reliable classification performance. To solve this task, we adopt the masking and prompt learning strategy and propose a novel framework called Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS). Specifically, we design a multi-level masking strategy to promote effective feature modeling under partial and irregular observations. To mitigate the loss of contextual information introduced by masking, we further propose a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism that aggregates unmasked data into a global prompt, serving as a semantic anchor for guiding both patch-level and epoch-level feature modeling.

Parameter sharing, a form of structured compression, effectively reduces redundancy, but existing approaches remain heuristic-restricted to adjacent layers and lacking a systematic analysis for cross-layer sharing. However, extending sharing across multiple layers leads to an exponentially expanding configuration space, making exhaustive search computationally infeasible and forming a critical bottleneck for parameter sharing. We recast parameter sharing from a group-theoretic perspective as introducing structural symmetries in the model's parameter space. A sharing configuration can be described by a coloring function $\u03b1:L\\rightarrow C$ (L: layer indices and C: sharing classes), which determines inter-layer sharing groups while preserving structural symmetry. To determine the coloring function, we propose a second-order geometric criterion based on Taylor expansion and the Hessian spectrum. By projecting perturbations onto the Hessian's low-curvature eigensubspace, the criterion provides an analytic rule for selecting sharing groups that minimize performance impact, yielding a principled and scalable configuration procedure. Across diverse architectures and tasks, Geo-Sharing consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic sharing strategies, achieving higher compression ratios with smaller accuracy degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u51c6\u5219\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u65b9\u6cd5Geo-Sharing\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7fa4\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u9636\u51e0\u4f55\u51c6\u5219\u9009\u62e9\u5171\u4eab\u7ec4\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5de8\u5927\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u76f8\u90bb\u5c42\u5171\u4eab\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u5c42\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u800c\u8de8\u5c42\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5448\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u7fa4\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u548c\u6d77\u68ee\u8c31\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u51e0\u4f55\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6270\u52a8\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6d77\u68ee\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4f4e\u66f2\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u5171\u4eab\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cGeo-Sharing\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5171\u4eab\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u548c\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "Geo-Sharing\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u5219\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u51c6\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u4e2d\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically presuppose perfect priors or can only handle specific, pre-identified error types. And their performance degrades substantially when confronted with flawed constraints of unknown location and type. This decline arises because most of them rely on inflexible and biased thresholding strategies that may conflict with the data distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose to harmonizes knowledge and data through prior alignment and conflict resolution. First, we assess the credibility of imperfect structural constraints through a surrogate model, which then guides a sparse penalization term measuring the loss between the learned and constrained adjacency matrices. We theoretically prove that, under ideal assumption, the knowledge-driven objective aligns with the data-driven objective. Furthermore, to resolve conflicts when this assumption is violated, we introduce a multi-task learning framework optimized via multi-gradient descent, jointly minimizing both objectives. Our proposed method is robust to both linear and nonlinear settings. Extensive experiments, conducted under diverse noise conditions and structural equation model types, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method under imperfect structural constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\u6765\u534f\u8c03\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u6709\u504f\u7684\u9608\u503c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u51b2\u7a81", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u7a00\u758f\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8054\u5408\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u76ee\u6807", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898"}}

However, their broad knowledge capacity raises growing concerns about privacy leakage, toxicity mitigation, and intellectual property violations. Machine Unlearning (MU) offers a practical solution by selectively forgetting targeted knowledge while preserving overall model utility. When applied to MLLMs, existing neuron-editing-based MU approaches face two fundamental challenges: (1) forgetting becomes inconsistent across modalities because existing point-wise attribution methods fail to capture the structured, layer-by-layer information flow that connects different modalities; and (2) general knowledge performance declines when sensitive neurons that also support important reasoning paths are pruned, as this disrupts the model's ability to generalize. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a multimodal influential neuron path editor (MIP-Editor) for MU. Our approach introduces modality-specific attribution scores to identify influential neuron paths responsible for encoding forget-set knowledge and applies influential-path-aware neuron-editing via representation misdirection. This strategy also enables effective and coordinated forgetting across modalities while preserving the model's general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that MIP-Editor achieves a superior unlearning performance on multimodal tasks, with a maximum forgetting rate of 87.75% and up to 54.26% improvement in general knowledge retention.

However, existing machine unlearning algorithms frequently neglect the fact that different data points may contribute unequally to model performance (i.e., heterogeneous data values). Treat them equally in machine unlearning procedure can potentially degrading the performance of updated models. To address this limitation, we propose Data Value-Weighted Unlearning (DVWU), a general unlearning framework that accounts for data value heterogeneity into the unlearning process. Specifically, we design a weighting strategy based on data values, which are then integrated into the unlearning procedure to enable differentiated unlearning for data points with varying utility to the model. The DVWU framework can be broadly adapted to various existing machine unlearning methods. We use the one-step Newton update as an example for implementation, developing both output and objective perturbation algorithms to achieve certified unlearning. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods achieve superior predictive performance and robustness compared to conventional unlearning approaches. We further show the extensibility of our framework on gradient ascent method by incorporating the proposed weighting strategy into the gradient terms, highlighting the adaptability of DVWU for broader gradient-based deep unlearning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8003\u8651\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6DVWU\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e73\u7b49\u5904\u7406\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u4ee5\u4e00\u9636\u725b\u987f\u66f4\u65b0\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6270\u52a8\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cDVWU\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DVWU\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9057\u5fd8\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

FedNET employs Federated Learning (FL) to model the temporal evolution of node-level traffic in a distributed manner, enabling accurate multi-step-ahead predictions (e.g., several hours to days) without exposing sensitive network data. Using these node-level forecasts and known routing information, FedNET estimates the future link-level utilization by aggregating traffic contributions across all source-destination pairs. The links are then ranked according to the predicted load intensity and temporal variability, providing an early warning signal for potential high-risk links. We compare the federated traffic prediction of FedNET against a centralized multi-step learning baseline and then systematically analyze the impact of history and prediction window sizes on forecast accuracy using the $R^2$ score. Results indicate that FL achieves accuracy close to centralized training, with shorter prediction horizons consistently yielding the highest accuracy ($R^2 >0.92$), while longer horizons providing meaningful forecasts ($R^2 \\approx 0.45\\text{--}0.55$).

Chae"], "title": "Recursive Dynamics in Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Networks: Toward Reflective Intelligence", "comment": "17 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "This study introduces the Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Layer (FH-RL), a neural mechanism that integrates fast-weight associative memory, homeostatic regularization, and learned reentrant feedback to approximate self-referential computation in neural networks. Unlike standard transformer architectures that operate in a purely feedforward manner during inference, FH-RL enables internal recurrence without external looping, allowing prior latent states to be dynamically re-entered into the ongoing computation stream. We conduct controlled experiments sweeping the reentry gain $\u03b3$ and evaluate emergent internal dynamics using three novel metrics: the Information Reentry Ratio (IRR), Eigen-Spectrum Recursion Index (ESRI), and Representational Drift Periodicity (RDP). Results show that reentry quantity increases proportionally with~$\u03b3$, while the learned feedback matrix $W_r$ remains bounded and becomes more structured at moderate gains. Critically, a stable reflective band emerges around $\u03b3\\approx 0.10-0.20$, where internal feedback is maximally expressive yet spectrally stable: IRR rises smoothly, ESRI remains near zero, and RDP exhibits consistent low-frequency cycles. These findings provide quantitative evidence that reflective, thought-like internal processing can arise from a principled balance between feedback amplification and homeostatic regulation, linking modern fast-weight architectures to theories of cortical reentry and recursive cognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "FH-RL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u7a33\u6001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6307\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u5185\u90e8\u9012\u5f52\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4ec5\u4ee5\u7eaf\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u90e8\u9012\u5f52\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u65b0\u8f93\u5165\u5148\u524d\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u5230\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Layer (FH-RL)\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u7a33\u6001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u626b\u63cf\u91cd\u5165\u589e\u76ca\u03b3\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\uff1a\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u5165\u6bd4(IRR)\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u8c31\u9012\u5f52\u6307\u6570(ESRI)\u548c\u8868\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\u5468\u671f\u6027(RDP)\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u5165\u6570\u91cf\u968f\u03b3\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u53cd\u9988\u77e9\u9635W_r\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u754c\u5e76\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u589e\u76ca\u4e0b\u66f4\u5177\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u3002\u5728\u03b3\u22480.10-0.20\u5904\u51fa\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u5e26\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u6700\u5f3a\u4e14\u8c31\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1aIRR\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e0a\u5347\uff0cESRI\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\uff0cRDP\u663e\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u5468\u671f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u53cd\u9988\u653e\u5927\u548c\u7a33\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u53cd\u5c04\u6027\u3001\u7c7b\u4f3c\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u4ee3\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u76ae\u5c42\u91cd\u5165\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002"}}

First, a physics informed conditional neural field is trained to approximate the nonlinear parametric solutionof the governing equations. This establishes a continuous mapping between the parameter and solution spaces, which can then be evaluated for a given parameter at any spatial resolution. Second, since the neural approximation may not be exact, it is subsequently refined using a Newton-based correction initialized by the neural output. To evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid approach, we compare three solution strategies: (i) the standard Newton-Raphson solver used in NFEM, which is robust and accurate but computationally demanding; (ii) physics-informed neural operators, which provide rapid inference but may lose accuracy outside the training distribution and resolution; and (iii) the neural-initialized Newton (NiN) strategy, which combines the efficiency of neural operators with the robustness of NFEM.

However, modern semiconductor technologies with densely packed structures present significant challenges in unbiasedly sampling transition domains in walk steps with multiple high-contrast dielectric materials. We present DeepRWCap, a machine learning-guided random walk solver that predicts the transition quantities required to guide each step of the walk. These include Poisson kernels, gradient kernels, signs and magnitudes of weights. DeepRWCap employs a two-stage neural architecture that decomposes structured outputs into face-wise distributions and spatial kernels on cube faces. It uses 3D convolutional networks to capture volumetric dielectric interactions and 2D depthwise separable convolutions to model localized kernel behavior. The design incorporates grid-based positional encodings and structural design choices informed by cube symmetries to reduce learning redundancy and improve generalization.

First, M2M-DC ranks residual (or inverted-residual) blocks by a label-aware mutual information (MI) signal and removes the least informative units (structured prune-after-training). It then alternates short KD phases with stage-coherent, residual-safe channel slicing: (i) stage \"planes\" (co-slicing conv2 out-channels with the downsample path and next-stage inputs), and (ii) an optional mid-channel trim (conv1 out / bn1 / conv2 in). This targets complementary redundancy, whole computational motifs and within-stage width while preserving residual shape invariants. On CIFAR-100, M2M-DC yields a clean accuracy-compute frontier. For ResNet-18, we obtain 85.46% Top-1 with 3.09M parameters and 0.0139 GMacs (72% params, 63% GMacs vs. teacher; mean final 85.29% over three seeds). For ResNet-34, we reach 85.02% Top-1 with 5.46M params and 0.0195 GMacs (74% / 74% vs. teacher; mean final 84.62%). Extending to inverted-residuals, MobileNetV2 achieves a mean final 68.54% Top-1 at 1.71M params (27%) and 0.0186 conv GMacs (24%), improving over the teacher's 66.03% by +2.5 points across three seeds. Because M2M-DC exposes only a thin, architecture-aware interface (blocks, stages, and down sample/skip wiring), it generalizes across residual CNNs and extends to inverted-residual families with minor legalization rules.

Existing approaches for ISTS modeling primarily rely on observed values to impute unobserved ones or infer latent dynamics. However, these methods overlook a critical source of learning signal: the reconstruction error inherently produced during model training. Such error implicitly reflects how well a model captures the underlying data structure and can serve as an informative proxy for unobserved values. To exploit this insight, we propose iTimER, a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training framework for ISTS representation learning. iTimER models the distribution of reconstruction errors over observed values and generates pseudo-observations for unobserved timestamps through a mixup strategy between sampled errors and the last available observations. This transforms unobserved timestamps into noise-aware training targets, enabling meaningful reconstruction signals.

By allowing energy to change over time, the NCGSB provides a broader class of real-world stochastic processes, capturing richer and more faithful intermediate dynamics. By parameterizing the Wasserstein manifold, we lift the bridge problem to a tractable geodesic computation in a finite-dimensional space. Unlike computationally expensive iterative solutions, our contact Wasserstein geodesic (CWG) is naturally implemented via a ResNet architecture and relies on a non-iterative solver with near-linear complexity.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) presents a promising solution, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning by updating only a small number of adaptation weights per layer. Traditional PEFT methods typically rely on a single expert, where the adaptation weight is a low-rank matrix. However, for complex tasks, the data's inherent diversity poses a significant challenge for such models, as a single adaptation weight cannot adequately capture the features of all samples. To address this limitation, we explore how to integrate multiple small adaptation experts into a compact structure to defeat a large adapter. Specifically, we propose Tucker Adaptation (TuckA), a method with four key properties: (i) We use Tucker decomposition to create a compact 3D tensor where each slice naturally serves as an expert. The low-rank nature of this decomposition ensures that the number of parameters scales efficiently as more experts are added. (ii) We introduce a hierarchical strategy that organizes these experts into groups at different granularities, allowing the model to capture both local and global data patterns. (iii) We develop an efficient batch-level routing mechanism, which reduces the router's parameter size by a factor of $L$ compared to routing at every adapted layer (where $L$ is the number of adapted layers) (iv) We propose data-aware initialization to achieve loss-free expert load balancing based on theoretical analysis.

These insights motivate DeepBooTS, a novel end-to-end dual-stream residual-decreasing boosting method that progressively reconstructs the intrinsic signal. In our design, each block of a deep model becomes an ensemble of learners with an auxiliary output branch forming a highway to the final prediction. The block-wise outputs correct the residuals of previous blocks, leading to a learning-driven decomposition of both inputs and targets.

This fundamental weakness leads to noisy, unstable anomaly scores with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, hindering reliable detection. To address this, we propose Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing (COGNOS), a universal, model-agnostic enhancement framework that tackles this issue at its source. COGNOS introduces a novel Gaussian-White Noise Regularization strategy during training, which directly constrains the model's output residuals to conform to a Gaussian white noise distribution. This engineered statistical property creates the ideal precondition for our second contribution: a Kalman Smoothing Post-processor that provably operates as a statistically optimal estimator to denoise the raw anomaly scores. The synergy between these two components allows COGNOS to robustly separate the true anomaly signal from random fluctuations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGNOS is highly effective, delivering an average F-score uplift of 57.9% when applied to 12 diverse backbone models across multiple real-world benchmark datasets.

We present preliminary evidence that DD exists in model-free DRL, investigating it systematically across varying model capacity using the Actor-Critic framework. We rely on an information-theoretic metric, Policy Entropy, to measure policy uncertainty throughout training. Preliminary results show a clear epoch-wise DD curve; the policy's entrance into the second descent region correlates with a sustained, significant reduction in Policy Entropy. This entropic decay suggests that over-parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, guiding the policy towards robust, flatter minima in the loss landscape.

Recent works improve this by introducing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, with the pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) used as teachers and the target SNNs as students. This is commonly accomplished through a straightforward element-wise alignment of intermediate features and prediction logits from ANNs and SNNs, often neglecting the intrinsic differences between their architectures. Specifically, ANN's outputs exhibit a continuous distribution, whereas SNN's outputs are characterized by sparsity and discreteness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce two innovative KD strategies. Firstly, we propose the Saliency-scaled Activation Map Distillation (SAMD), which aligns the spike activation map of the student SNN with the class-aware activation map of the teacher ANN. Rather than performing KD directly on the raw %and distinct features of ANN and SNN, our SAMD directs the student to learn from saliency activation maps that exhibit greater semantic and distribution consistency. Additionally, we propose a Noise-smoothed Logits Distillation (NLD), which utilizes Gaussian noise to smooth the sparse logits of student SNN, facilitating the alignment with continuous logits from teacher ANN. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

To meet this need, data is collected from multiple domains, such as Wikipedia and GitHub. These domains are heterogeneous in both data quality and the diversity of information they provide. This raises the question of how much we should rely on each domain. Several methods have attempted to address this issue by assigning sampling weights to each data domain using heuristics or approximations. As a first step toward a deeper understanding of the role of data mixing, this work revisits the problem by studying two kinds of weights: sampling weights, which control how much each domain contributes in a batch, and loss weights, which scale the loss from each domain during training. Through a rigorous study of linear regression, we show that these two weights play complementary roles. First, they can reduce the variance of gradient estimates in iterative methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Second, they can improve generalization performance by reducing the generalization gap. We provide both theoretical and empirical support for these claims.

However, unlike natural language corpora, RL trajectories are sparse and reward-driven, making standard self-attention inefficient because it distributes weight uniformly across all past tokens rather than emphasizing the few transitions critical for control. To address this, we introduce structured inductive priors into the self-attention mechanism of the dynamics head: (i) per-head memory-length priors that constrain attention to task-specific windows, and (ii) distributional priors that learn smooth Gaussian weightings over past state-action pairs. We integrate these mechanisms into UniZero, a model-based RL agent with a Transformer-based world model that supports planning under partial observability. Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that most efficiency gains arise from the Gaussian prior, which smoothly allocates attention to informative transitions, while memory-length priors often truncate useful signals with overly restrictive cut-offs. In particular, Gaussian Attention achieves a 77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores over UniZero. These findings suggest that in partially observable RL domains with non-stationary temporal dependencies, discrete memory windows are difficult to learn reliably, whereas smooth distributional priors flexibly adapt across horizons and yield more robust data efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that encoding structured temporal priors directly into self-attention improves the prioritization of informative histories for dynamics modeling under partial observability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f52\u7eb3\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u957f\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u5230Transformer\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5173\u6ce8\u5173\u952e\u5386\u53f2\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5747\u5300\u5206\u914d\u6743\u91cd\u7ed9\u6240\u6709\u5386\u53f2\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5c11\u6570\u5173\u952e\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5934\u90e8\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f52\u7eb3\u5148\u9a8c\uff1a(i) \u6bcf\u4e2a\u5934\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u957f\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9650\u5236\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\uff1b(ii) \u5206\u5e03\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u5386\u53f2\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u9ad8\u65af\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u5728Atari 100k\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8677%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u800c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u957f\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u5f80\u5f80\u56e0\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u622a\u65ad\u800c\u524a\u5f31\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4bRL\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u5e03\u5148\u9a8c\u6bd4\u79bb\u6563\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7a97\u53e3\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

These limitations hinder their ability to capture the sharp, high-frequency signals that often define tabular structure, especially under limited labeled samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers promise in such settings, it remains challenging in tabular domains due to the lack of effective data augmentations. We propose a hybrid autoencoder that combines a neural encoder with an oblivious soft decision tree (OSDT) encoder, each guided by its own stochastic gating network that performs sample-specific feature selection. Together, these structurally different encoders and model-specific gating networks implement model-based augmentation, producing complementary input views tailored to each architecture. The two encoders, trained with a shared decoder and cross-reconstruction loss, learn distinct yet aligned representations that reflect their respective inductive biases.

We demonstrate that representing the prior and likelihood in a suitable orthogonal basis transforms the Bayesian update rule into a spectral convolution. Specifically, the Fourier coefficients of the posterior are shown to be the normalized convolution of the prior and likelihood coefficients. To achieve computational feasibility, we introduce a spectral truncation scheme, which, for smooth functions, yields an exceptionally accurate finite-dimensional approximation and reduces the update to a circular convolution. This formulation allows us to exploit the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), resulting in a deterministic algorithm with O(N log N) complexity -- a substantial improvement over the O(N^2) cost of naive methods.

However, existing SC methods, which are largely based on linear models or shallow neural networks, face significant limitations in terms of scalability and capacity when applied to real-world datasets with significantly increasing scale, especially in financial services and the internet sector. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage large language models to design a more scalable and efficient SC framework, especially in the case of growing individuals engaged with decision-making processes. Specifically, we introduce GLIM, a gradient-free SC method grounded in in-context learning. During the feed-forward process of self-attention, GLIM implicitly simulates the typical bi-level optimization process of SC, including both the feature manipulation and decision rule optimization. Without fine-tuning the LLMs, our proposed GLIM enjoys the advantage of cost-effective adaptation in dynamic strategic environments. Theoretically, we prove GLIM can support pre-trained LLMs to adapt to a broad range of strategic manipulations.

Prior work often utilizes model ensembles or multi-agent systems to collaboratively generate responses, effectively operating in a server-to-server paradigm.

In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{CoLM} (\\textbf{Co}llaboration in \\textbf{L}arge-\\textbf{M}odels), a novel framework for collaborative reasoning that redefines cooperation among large models from a client-server perspective. Unlike traditional ensemble methods that rely on simultaneous inference from multiple models to produce a single output, CoLM allows the outputs of multiple models to be aggregated or shared, enabling each client model to independently refine and update its own generation based on these high-quality outputs. This design enables collaborative benefits by fully leveraging both client-side and shared server-side models. We further extend CoLM to vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrating its applicability beyond language tasks.

Existing deep learning methods, from early regression models to recent contrastive learning approaches, primarily rely on structural data while overlooking protein sequences, which are more accessible and can enhance generalizability. However, directly integrating protein sequences poses challenges due to the redundancy and noise in large-scale protein-ligand datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{S$^2$Drug}, a two-stage framework that explicitly incorporates protein \\textbf{S}equence information and 3D \\textbf{S}tructure context in protein-ligand contrastive representation learning. In the first stage, we perform protein sequence pretraining on ChemBL using an ESM2-based backbone, combined with a tailored data sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and noise on both protein and ligand sides. In the second stage, we fine-tune on PDBBind by fusing sequence and structure information through a residue-level gating module, while introducing an auxiliary binding site prediction task.

However, existing GAD methods assume identical training and testing distributions, which is rarely valid in practice. In real-world scenarios, unseen but normal samples may emerge during deployment, leading to a normality shift that degrades the performance of GAD models trained on the original data. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that the degradation arises from (1) semantic confusion, where unseen normal samples are misinterpreted as anomalies due to their novel patterns, and (2) aggregation contamination, where the representations of seen normal nodes are distorted by unseen normals through message aggregation. While retraining or fine-tuning GAD models could be a potential solution to the above challenges, the high cost of model retraining and the difficulty of obtaining labeled data often render this approach impractical in real-world applications. To bridge the gap, we proposed a lightweight and plug-and-play Test-time adaptation framework for correcting Unseen Normal pattErns (TUNE) in GAD. To address semantic confusion, a graph aligner is employed to align the shifted data to the original one at the graph attribute level. Moreover, we utilize the minimization of representation-level shift as a supervision signal to train the aligner, which leverages the estimated aggregation contamination as a key indicator of normality shift. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that TUNE significantly enhances the generalizability of pre-trained GAD models to both synthetic and real unseen normal patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TUNE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u5668\u548c\u8868\u793a\u7ea7\u504f\u79fb\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u672a\u89c1\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\u548c\u805a\u5408\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u800c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u5668\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea7\u522b\u5bf9\u9f50\u504f\u79fb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8868\u793a\u7ea7\u504f\u79fb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u9f50\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u805a\u5408\u6c61\u67d3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u6001\u6027\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTUNE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u672a\u89c1\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TUNE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6821\u6b63\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u5e94\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To reduce overhead, many protocols disclose intermediate centroids during training. While often treated as harmless for efficiency, whether such disclosure compromises privacy remains an open question. Prior analyses modeled the problem as a so-called Hidden Subset Sum Problem (HSSP) and argued that centroid release may be safe, since classical HSSP attacks fail to recover inputs.\n  We revisit this question and uncover a new leakage mechanism: temporal regularities in $k$-means iterations create exploitable structure that enables perfect input reconstruction. Building on this insight, we propose Trajectory-Aware Reconstruction (TAR), an attack that combines temporal assignment information with algebraic analysis to recover exact original inputs.

With latent variables drawn from a tractable probability density function that can be further constrained, these models enable continuous and semantically rich exploration of the output space by navigating their latent spaces. Structured latent representations are typically obtained through the joint minimization of regularization loss functions. In variational information bottleneck models, reconstruction loss and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) are often linearly combined with an auxiliary Attribute-Regularization (AR) loss. However, balancing KLD and AR turns out to be a very delicate matter. When KLD dominates over AR, generative models tend to lack controllability; when AR dominates over KLD, the stochastic encoder is encouraged to violate the standard normal prior. We explore this trade-off in the context of symbolic music generation with explicit control over continuous musical attributes.

While recent work highlights LLMs' emerging causal reasoning abilities, there lacks comprehensive benchmarks to assess their causal learning and performance informed by causal features in clinical risk prediction. To address this, we introduce REACT-LLM, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether combining LLMs with causal features can enhance clinical prognostic performance and potentially outperform traditional machine learning (ML) methods.

Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform reasonably in clinical prognostics, they have not yet outperformed traditional ML models.

However, existing methodologies primarily rely on musical context or natural language as the main modality of interacting with the generative process, which may not be ideal for expert users who seek precise fader-like control over specific musical attributes. In this work, we explore the application of denoising diffusion processes as plug-and-play latent constraints for unconditional symbolic music generation models. We focus on a framework that leverages a library of small conditional diffusion models operating as implicit probabilistic priors on the latents of a frozen unconditional backbone. While previous studies have explored domain-specific use cases, this work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate the versatility of such an approach across a diverse array of musical attributes, such as note density, pitch range, contour, and rhythm complexity. Our experiments show that diffusion-driven constraints outperform traditional attribute regularization and other latent constraints architectures, achieving significantly stronger correlations between target and generated attributes while maintaining high perceptual quality and diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u97f3\u4e50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u578b\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5e93\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u6982\u7387\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u97f3\u4e50\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u97f3\u4e50\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6216\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u7279\u5b9a\u97f3\u4e50\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u6765\u8bf4\u5e76\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5e93\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u6982\u7387\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u6269\u6563\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u6f5c\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5c5e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u6b21\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u97f3\u4e50\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u97f3\u7b26\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u97f3\u9ad8\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u8f6e\u5ed3\u548c\u8282\u594f\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff09\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7c7b\u63a8\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Traditional methods typically rely on logical labels, such as binary indicators (e.g., \"yes/no\") that specify whether an instance belongs to a given category. However, in practical applications, label annotations often involve significant uncertainty due to factors such as data noise, inherent ambiguity in the observed entities, and the subjectivity of human annotators. Therefore, representing labels using simplistic binary logic can obscure valuable information and limit the expressiveness of label learning models. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the concept of fuzzy labels, grounded in fuzzy set theory, to better capture and represent label uncertainty. We further propose an efficient fuzzy labeling method that mines and generates fuzzy labels from the original data, thereby enriching the label space with more informative and nuanced representations. Based on this foundation, we present fuzzy-label-enhanced algorithms for both single-label and multi-label learning, using the classical K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and multi-label KNN algorithms as illustrative examples.

However, in reality, the number of allowed queries can be severely limited. In this paper, we demonstrate how an adversary can extract the GNN with very limited interactions with the model. Our approach first enables the adversary to obtain the model backbone without making direct queries to the victim model and then to strategically utilize a fixed query limit to extract the most informative data. The experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack, even under a very restricted query limit and under defense against model extraction in place.

However, especially on Neural Networks, property enforcement is very challenging, and existing methods are limited to specific constraints or local properties (defined around datapoints), or fail to provide full guarantees. We tackle these limitations by extending SMiLE, a recently proposed enforcement framework for NNs, to support global relational properties (defined over the entire input space). The proposed approach scales well with model complexity, accommodates general properties and backbones, and provides full satisfaction guarantees. We evaluate SMiLE on monotonicity, global robustness, and individual fairness, on synthetic and real data, for regression and classification tasks. Our approach is competitive with property-specific baselines in terms of accuracy and runtime, and strictly superior in terms of generality and level of guarantees.

We then diagnose its root cause by analyzing internal representations, identifying a phenomenon we call \\textit{few-layer dominance}: only a small subset of layers are functionally important, while the majority are redundant, under-utilized, and can even distract training. Based on this discovery, we propose a practical method to automatically identify and retain only these dominant layers.

This closed-form solution hinges on the invertibility of the limiting kernel, a property that often holds on real-world datasets. In this work, we analyze the sensitivity of large ReLU networks to increasing depths by characterizing the corresponding limiting kernel. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the normalized limiting kernel approaches the matrix of ones.

Current multi-modal solutions suffer from static semantic rigidity: predefined candidate words fail to adapt to dataset-specific concepts, and fixed fusion strategies ignore evolving feature interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-DProxy, a novel multi-modal dynamic proxy learning framework that leverages cross-modal alignment through learnable textual proxies. Multi-DProxy introduces 1) gated cross-modal fusion that synthesizes discriminative joint representations by adaptively modeling feature interactions. 2) dual-constraint proxy optimization where user interest constraints enforce semantic consistency with domain concepts while concept constraints employ hard example mining to enhance cluster discrimination. 3) dynamic candidate management that refines textual proxies through iterative clustering feedback. Therefore, Multi-DProxy not only effectively captures a user's interest through proxies but also enables the identification of relevant clusterings with greater precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements over existing methods across a broad set of multi-clustering benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Multi-DProxy\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u4ee3\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4ee3\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u548c\u9759\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u521a\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u591a\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u7b5b\u9009\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u9759\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u521a\u6027\uff0c\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5019\u9009\u8bcd\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u95e8\u63a7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u5224\u522b\u6027\u8054\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff1b2\uff09\u53cc\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee3\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u7ea6\u675f\u786e\u4fdd\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea6\u675f\u901a\u8fc7\u96be\u4f8b\u6316\u6398\u589e\u5f3a\u805a\u7c7b\u5224\u522b\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u5019\u9009\u7ba1\u7406\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u805a\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u7cbe\u70bc\u6587\u672c\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u591a\u805a\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "Multi-DProxy\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7406\u6355\u83b7\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u805a\u7c7b\u3002"}}

However, existing RSSI-based positioning methods often suffer from reduced accuracy due to environmental complexity and challenges in processing multi-source information. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-graph heterogeneous GNN framework (MG-HGNN) to enhance spatial awareness and improve positioning performance. In this framework, two graph construction branches perform node and edge embedding, respectively, to generate informative graphs. Subsequently, a heterogeneous graph neural network is employed for graph representation learning, enabling accurate positioning. The MG-HGNN framework introduces the following key innovations: 1) multi-type task-directed graph construction that combines label estimation and feature encoding for richer graph information; 2) a heterogeneous GNN structure that enhances the performance of conventional GNN models. Evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc public datasets demonstrate that MG-HGNN not only achieves superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods, but also provides a novel perspective for enhancing GNN-based localization methods.

Building on this perspective, we develop a thermodynamic framework to describe the stationary distributions of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with weight decay for scale-invariant neural networks, a setting that both reflects practical architectures with normalization layers and permits theoretical analysis. We establish analogies between training hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, weight decay) and thermodynamic variables such as temperature, pressure, and volume. Starting with a simplified isotropic noise model, we uncover a close correspondence between SGD dynamics and ideal gas behavior, validated through theory and simulation. Extending to training of neural networks, we show that key predictions of the framework, including the behavior of stationary entropy, align closely with experimental observations.

However, most existing RAG methods focus on single-step retrieval, which is often insufficient for answering complex questions that require multi-step search. Recently, multi-step retrieval approaches have emerged, typically involving the fine-tuning of small LLMs to perform multi-step retrieval. This type of fine-tuning is highly resource-intensive and does not enable the use of larger LLMs. In this work, we propose Q-RAG, a novel approach that fine-tunes the Embedder model for multi-step retrieval using reinforcement learning (RL).

While large datasets exist for web and mobile interactions, high-quality resources for desktop environments are limited. To address this gap, we introduce GroundCUA, a large-scale desktop grounding dataset built from expert human demonstrations. It covers 87 applications across 12 categories and includes 56K screenshots, with every on-screen element carefully annotated for a total of over 3.56M human-verified annotations. From these demonstrations, we generate diverse instructions that capture a wide range of real-world tasks, providing high-quality data for model training. Using GroundCUA, we develop the GroundNext family of models that map instructions to their target UI elements. At both 3B and 7B scales, GroundNext achieves state-of-the-art results across five benchmarks using supervised fine-tuning, while requiring less than one-tenth the training data of prior work. Reinforcement learning post-training further improves performance, and when evaluated in an agentic setting on the OSWorld benchmark using o3 as planner, GroundNext attains comparable or superior results to models trained with substantially more data,.

While these expressive models do not yet match the peak performance of state-of-the-art Transformers, their potential has been largely untapped due to prohibitively slow training and low hardware utilization. Existing parallelization methods force a fundamental conflict governed by the chunksize hyperparameter: large chunks boost speed but degrade performance, necessitating a fixed, suboptimal compromise. To solve this challenge, we introduce TNT, a novel training paradigm that decouples training efficiency from inference performance through a two-stage process. Stage one is an efficiency-focused pre-training phase utilizing a hierarchical memory. A global module processes large, hardware-friendly chunks for long-range context, while multiple parallel local modules handle fine-grained details. Crucially, by periodically resetting local memory states, we break sequential dependencies to enable massive context parallelization. Stage two is a brief fine-tuning phase where only the local memory modules are adapted to a smaller, high-resolution chunksize, maximizing accuracy with minimal overhead. Evaluated on Titans and TTT models, TNT achieves a substantial acceleration in training speed-up to 17 times faster than the most accurate baseline configuration - while simultaneously improving model accuracy. This improvement removes a critical scalability barrier, establishing a practical foundation for developing expressive RNNs and facilitating future work to close the performance gap with Transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "TNT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5fc6RNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5185\u5b58\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80\u77ed\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5fc6RNN\uff08\u5982Titans\u548cTTT\uff09\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u6781\u6162\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5185\u5b58\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5757\u5904\u7406\u5927\u5757\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u591a\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u5904\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728Titans\u548cTTT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cTNT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe17\u500d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TNT\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5fc6RNN\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8868\u8fbe\u6027RNN\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e0eTransformer\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

In this work, we extend self-evaluation techniques to multi-step tasks, testing two intuitive approaches: holistic scoring and step-by-step scoring. Using two multi-step benchmark datasets, we show that stepwise evaluation generally outperforms holistic scoring in detecting potential errors, with up to 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC.

While recent work highlights the role of exploration and entropy stability in improving pass@K, empirical evidence points to a paradox: RLVR and ORM/PRM typically reinforce existing tree-like reasoning paths rather than expanding the reasoning scope, raising the question of why exploration helps at all if no new patterns emerge.\n  To reconcile this paradox, we adopt the perspective of Kim et al. (2025), viewing easy (e.g., simplifying a fraction) versus hard (e.g., discovering a symmetry) reasoning steps as low- versus high-probability Markov transitions, and formalize post-training dynamics through Multi-task Tree-structured Markov Chains (TMC). In this tractable model, pretraining corresponds to tree expansion, while post-training corresponds to chain-of-thought reweighting. We show that several phenomena recently observed in empirical studies arise naturally in this setting: (1) RLVR induces a squeezing effect, reducing reasoning entropy and forgetting some correct paths; (2) population rewards of ORM/PRM encourage consistency rather than accuracy, thereby favoring common patterns; and (3) certain rare, high-uncertainty reasoning paths by the base model are responsible for solving hard problem instances.\n  Together, these explain why exploration -- even when confined to the base model's reasoning scope -- remains essential: it preserves access to rare but crucial reasoning traces needed for difficult cases, which are squeezed out by RLVR or unfavored by inference scaling. Building on this, we further show that exploration strategies such as rejecting easy instances and KL regularization help preserve rare reasoning traces.

To address this gap, we develop a theoretical framework grounded in the intuition that progressively learning through manageable steps is more efficient than directly tackling a hard reasoning task, provided each stage stays within the model's effective competence. Under mild complexity conditions linking consecutive curriculum stages, we show that curriculum post-training avoids the exponential complexity bottleneck.\n  To substantiate this result, drawing insights from the Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) solving mathematical problems such as Countdown and parity, we model CoT generation as a states-conditioned autoregressive reasoning tree, define a uniform-branching base model to capture pretrained behavior, and formalize curriculum stages as either depth-increasing (longer reasoning chains) or hint-decreasing (shorter prefixes) subtasks. Our analysis shows that, under outcome-only reward signals, reinforcement learning finetuning achieves high accuracy with polynomial sample complexity, whereas direct learning suffers from an exponential bottleneck.

A crucial question about AI reasoning is whether models can extrapolate learned reasoning patterns to solve harder tasks with longer chain-of-thought (CoT). In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of transformers learning on synthetic state-tracking tasks with gradient descent. We mathematically prove how the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems governs the degree of extrapolation of the learned CoT. Specifically, our theory characterizes the length generalization of transformers through the mechanism of attention concentration, linking the retrieval robustness of the attention layer to the state-tracking task structure of long-context reasoning. Moreover, for transformers with limited reasoning length, we prove that a recursive self-training scheme can progressively extend the range of solvable problem lengths. To our knowledge, we provide the first optimization guarantee that constant-depth transformers provably learn $\\mathsf{NC}^1$-complete problems with CoT, significantly going beyond prior art confined in $\\mathsf{TC}^0$, unless the widely held conjecture $\\mathsf{TC}^0 \\neq \\mathsf{NC}^1$ fails.

LoReTTA operates through a two-stage approach: (1) sparsify the graph by removing high-impact edges using any of the 16 tested temporal importance metrics, (2) strategically replace removed edges with adversarial negatives via LoReTTA's novel degree-preserving negative sampling algorithm.

Shortening these sequences typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to natural sequences. As a generative model, SCISOR fits evolutionary sequence data competitively with previous large models. In evaluation, SCISOR achieves state-of-the-art predictions of the functional effects of deletions on ProteinGym.

A promising solution is to use cascaded inference, where small, cheap models handle easy queries, and only the hardest examples are escalated to more powerful models. However, existing cascade methods typically rely on supervised training with labeled data, offer no theoretical generalization guarantees, and provide limited control over test-time computational cost. We introduce C3PO (Cost Controlled Cascaded Prediction Optimization), a self-supervised framework for optimizing LLM cascades under probabilistic cost constraints. By focusing on minimizing regret with respect to the most powerful model (MPM), C3PO avoids the need for labeled data by constructing a cascade using only unlabeled model outputs. It leverages conformal prediction to bound the probability that inference cost exceeds a user-specified budget. We provide theoretical guarantees on both cost control and generalization error, and show that our optimization procedure is effective even with small calibration sets. Empirically, C3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of reasoning benchmarks including GSM8K, MATH-500, BigBench-Hard and AIME, outperforming strong LLM cascading baselines in both accuracy and cost-efficiency.

However, evaluations on broad downstream tasks reveal a consistent suboptimality of the routers in existing MoE LLMs, which results in a severe performance gap (e.g., 10-20% in accuracy) to the optimal routing. In this paper, we show that aligning the manifold of routing weights with that of task embedding can effectively reduce the gap and improve MoE LLMs' generalization performance. Our method, \"Routing Manifold Alignment (RoMA)\", introduces an additional manifold regularization term in the post-training objective and only requires lightweight finetuning of routers (with other parameters frozen). Specifically, the regularization encourages the routing weights of each sample to be close to those of its successful neighbors (whose routing weights lead to correct answers) in a task embedding space. Consequently, samples targeting similar tasks will share similar expert choices across layers. Building such bindings between tasks and experts over different samples is essential to achieve better generalization. Moreover, RoMA demonstrates the advantage of unifying the task understanding (by embedding models) with solution generation (by MoE LLMs). In experiments, we finetune routers in OLMoE, DeepSeekMoE, and Qwen3-MoE using RoMA. Evaluations on diverse benchmarks and extensive comparisons with baselines show the substantial improvement brought by RoMA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRoMA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8def\u7531\u6d41\u5f62\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u4f18\u5316MoE LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u8def\u7531\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MoE LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u7531\u5b58\u572810-20%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6d41\u5f62\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\uff0c\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8def\u7531\u6743\u91cd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5176\u6210\u529f\u90bb\u5c45\u7684\u8def\u7531\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u8def\u7531\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u800c\u51bb\u7ed3\u5176\u4ed6\u53c2\u6570", "result": "\u5728OLMoE\u3001DeepSeekMoE\u548cQwen3-MoE\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRoMA\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb", "conclusion": "RoMA\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u8d77\u6765\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347MoE LLMs\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd"}}
