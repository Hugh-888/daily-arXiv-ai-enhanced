Here, we introduce a general framework for constructing Bell inequalities tailored to the $\\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code for odd prime local dimensions. Selecting a suitable subset of stabilizer operators and mapping them to generalized measurement observables, we compute multipartite Bell expressions whose quantum maxima admit a sum-of-squares decomposition. We show that these inequalities are maximally violated by all states in the ground-state manifold of the $\\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code, and determine their classical (local) bounds through a combination of combinatorial tiling arguments and explicit optimization. As a concrete application, we analyze the case of $d=3$ and demonstrate that the maximal violation self-tests the full qutrit toric-code subspace, up to local isometries and complex conjugation. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first-ever example of self-testing a qutrit subspace. Extending these constructions, we further present schemes to enhance the ratio of classical--quantum bounds and thus improve robustness to experimental imperfections. Our results establish a pathway toward device-independent certification of highly entangled topological quantum matter and provide new tools for validating qudit states in error-correcting codes and quantum simulation platforms."}

An $x$-dependent gauge transformation maps this to an equivalent description with explicit many-body potentials, illustrated by a temporal coupled-oscillator model that exhibits synchronization. Adopting a complementary spatial viewpoint with a static potential $U_{\\!tot}(\\mathbf x)$, we show that the evolution is driven by the collective force $\\sum_j\\partial_{x_j}U_{\\!tot}$; for any translation-invariant interaction (such as a regularized Coulomb potential), these internal forces cancel, rendering the collective dynamics free and highlighting Carrollian ultralocality. We also construct a coordinate duality mapping separable Schrödinger Hamiltonians to CS generators via Schwarzian derivatives. Exchange symmetry is formulated in the time domain, yielding temporal bunching for bosons and antibunching for fermions via the second-order coherence function $g^{(2)}(t,t')$. In second quantization, the contact limit yields a temporal derivative cubic--quintic nonlinear Schrödinger equation with a theoretically fixed nonlinearity coefficient $β=-3/16$.

A major challenge in DQC lies in reducing the communication cost introduced by remote CNOT gates, which are significantly slower and more resource-consuming than local operations. Existing DQC approaches treat the three essential components (qubit allocation, entanglement management, and network scheduling) as independent stages, optimizing each in isolation. However, we observe that these components are inherently interdependent, and therefore adopting a unified optimization strategy can be more efficient to achieve the global optimal solutions. Consequently, we propose UNIQ, a novel DQC optimization framework that integrates all three components into a non-linear integer programming (NIP) model. UNIQ aims to reduce the circuit runtime by maximizing parallel Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation through the use of idle communication qubits, while simultaneously minimizing the communication cost of remote gates. To solve this NP-hard formulated problem, we adopt two key strategies: a greedy algorithm for efficiently mapping logical qubits to different QPUs, and a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach that builds EPR pairs in parallel within each time slot. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach is widely applicable to diverse quantum circuits and QPU topologies, while substantially reducing communication cost and runtime over existing methods."}

We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations. We also study the photon sphere structure, black hole shadow radius, and photon trajectories, showing how the interplay between string clouds and the electromagnetic background shapes the optical properties of this spacetime.

Using the noncollinear Alexander-Anderson model, we have shown that the interaction of localized magnetic moments formed by itinerant electrons strongly depends on the position of the d-level relative to the Fermi level, which determines the number of localized electrons. Depending on this parameter, the ground state of the magnetic dimer can be ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or noncollinear without the effects of spin-orbit interaction. The magnetic state can be controlled by shifting the d-level with an electric field, even without current flow. For a sufficiently large value of the hopping parameter between localized states there can be several self-consistent solutions with different values of magnetic moments. This opens new possibilities for manipulation of the magnetic structure of nanosystems. The results obtained lead to a new interpretation of the mechanisms of magnetization reversal, recording, and deleting of magnetic structures in tunneling spectroscopy experiments."}

Numerical calculations indicate that the magnitudes of the coupling constants can be comparable to those in conventional circuits. On the basis of this theory, we designed a four-KPO circuit and experimentally confirmed the four-body correlation by measuring the pump-phase dependence of the parity of the four-KPO states. We show that the choice of the pump frequencies are important not only to enable the four-body interaction, but to cancel the effects of other unwanted interactions.

The study shows that the presence of a negative cosmological constant extends the range of dominant reconnection radial locations where the energy extraction condition is met, and enables energy extraction even from black holes with relatively low spin. Furthermore, the influence of the negative cosmological constant on energy extraction is modulated by the extent of the dominant reconnection radial region: a more negative cosmological constant enhances the extracted energy, efficiency, and power, particularly for smaller dominant reconnection radii. These results demonstrate that the energy extraction from Kerr-AdS black holes is more favorable than that from their asymptotically flat counterparts.

Rather than training neural networks to learn complete trajectories from scratch, we introduce Neural Network Perturbation Theory (NNPT), where networks predict only residual perturbations after analytically subtracting known exact solutions.\n  We validate this framework through systematic comparison: using identical 2x32 architectures, correction learning achieves 28-54x lower validation error compared to networks trained on complete trajectories. Using the gravitational three-body problem as a test bed, we investigate capacity transitions in fixed-architecture multilayer perceptrons as Jovian mass varies from 0.05 to 30 times its physical value. An equalized-accuracy protocol reveals that both minimal network capacity and training time exhibit sharp transitions at f_c = 15.6+-1.0, where the system enters a strongly chaotic regime. At this transition, minimal capacity jumps approximately sevenfold from ~1,200 to ~8,600 parameters (architectures 2x32 and 3x64).\n  Preliminary exploration of sequential two-stage corrections suggests that first-stage networks already capture dominant perturbative features. Our symplectic integrator maintains relative energy conservation below 2x10^-7 throughout, confirming that transitions reflect physical complexity rather than numerical error. Our results establish correction learning as a general strategy for parameter-efficient surrogates and demonstrate that physical complexity imposes fundamental capacity barriers on fixed-architecture networks at chaos onset."}

This rate has been conjectured by Maldecena et al. to obey a universal, temperature dependent bound. Recent studies have shown that instantons, delocalised structures that dominate tunnelling statistics over barriers, reduce the growth rate of OTOCs. For the case of the symmetric double well, this reduction ensures the bound is maintained for OTOCs generated using ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), a method with approximate dynamics but exact quantum statistics. In this report we set out to further understand the role of the instanton in the enforcement of the Maldacena bound and test whether RPMD is sufficient to satisfy the bound. We also investigate the impact of coherence on the flattening of of OTOCs by contrasting bounded with scattering systems. For the scattering system we observe a significantly smaller OTOC growth rate than that of the analogous bounded system, and a flattening in growth rate as time progresses. We attribute the first effect to influence of the Boltzmann operator, and the second to interference caused by anharmonicity of the potential. In our studies of RPMD, we find counterexamples showing that it is not sufficient to satisfy the bound. We develop a theory for OTOCs using (analytically-continued) Matsubara dynamics, revealing significantly different dynamical behaviour around the instanton compared to the predictions of RPMD. The instanton is found to be stationary in all coordinates but its collective angle $Φ_0$, and fluctuations about it no longer resemble that of classical dynamics on a first order saddle as in RPMD."}

In the P-alpha framework, applying a pressure-dependent yield strength is essential to capture the particle velocity evolution, though calibration of other constitutive parameters, such as crush-out pressure, still strongly influences the response. In contrast, mesoscale simulations are less sensitive to parameter tuning and rely critically on the physical state variable of porosity, represented in 2D as an equivalent measure of the 3D specimen.

Prior studies have employed Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states as ancillary qumodes to suppress small Gaussian displacement errors, but when the displacement magnitude becomes large, lattice-crossing events arise beyond the correctable range of the GKP state. To address this issue, we concatenate a Gaussian-noise-suppression circuit with an outer analog Steane code that corrects such occasional lattice-crossing events as well as other abrupt displacement errors. Unlike conventional concatenation, which primarily aims to reduce logical error rates, the Steane-GKP duality in encoding provides complementary protection against both large and small displacement errors, enabling CV error correction within the continuous encoding space and contrasting with earlier approaches that concatenate GKP states with repetition codes for discrete qubit or qudit encodings. Analytical results show that, under infinite squeezing, the concatenated code suppresses the variance of Gaussian displacement errors across all qumodes by up to 50 percent while enabling unbiased correction of lattice-crossing events, with a success probability determined by the ratio between the residual Gaussian error standard deviation and the lattice-crossing magnitude. Even with finite squeezing, the proposed architecture continues to provide Gaussian-error suppression together with lattice-crossing correction, and the presence of the outer analog Steane code relaxes the squeezing requirement of the inner GKP states, indicating near-term experimental feasibility. This work establishes a viable route toward fault-tolerant continuous-variable quantum computation and provides new insight into the design of concatenated CV error-correcting architectures."}

This approach outperformed existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Mexilhao field (Santos Basin, Brazil) dataset with a validation IoU of 0.881 and MAE of 2.49ms, and excellent surface coverage of 97.6% on the F3 Block of the North Sea dataset under sparse conditions. The framework further refines merged horizon predictions (inline and cross-line) using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to produce geologically plausible surfaces. The results demonstrate the advantages of hybrid methodologies and attention-based architectures enhanced with geometric context, providing a robust and generalizable solution for seismic interpretation in structurally complex and data-scarce environments."}

In addition to the well-known asymptotic quantities such as the Bondi-Sachs energy-momentum, the BMS charges and NP constants of this spacetime are computed. Explicit calculations of the latter are relatively scarce in the literature. Moreover, it has been proven that the NP constants of asymptotically flat, stationary, vacuum, and algebraically special spacetimes vanish (for instance, those of the Kerr spacetime). A by-product of the present analysis is to show that the algebraically special condition in the aforementioned result appears to be crucial, since the q-metric provides a counterexample to the conjecture that all asymptotically flat, stationary, vacuum, and asymptotically algebraically special spacetimes (a weaker version of the algebraically special condition) have vanishing NP constants."}

In this work, we demonstrate the use of multiple-quantum solid-state NMR for quantum sensing by creating, manipulating, and detecting large clusters of correlated nuclear spins. We show that such clusters can sensitively detect pulse-width jitters in radio-frequency control fields at the level of tens of nanoseconds. By analyzing the response of high-order quantum coherences to these control-field jitters, we investigate the critical interplay between the enhanced sensitivity offered by large coherence orders, their relative distributions, and their varying susceptibility to decoherence. We further demonstrate that, even within a non-uniform distribution of coherence orders, there exists an optimal maximum coherence order that maximizes sensing efficiency. To support our interpretation, we supplement the experimental results with a simplified numerical model that estimates the corresponding quantum Fisher information. These results support the solid-state NMR platform as a valuable testbed for investigating many-body quantum metrology protocols."}

By analysing the Riemannian pullback metric across layers of a neural network, we find that network computation can be decomposed into two functions: discretising continuous input features and performing logical operations on these discretised variables. Furthermore, we demonstrate how different learning regimes (rich vs. lazy) have contrasting metric and curvature structures, affecting the ability of the networks to generalise to unseen inputs. Overall, our work provides a geometric framework for understanding how neural networks learn to perform discrete computations on continuous manifolds."}

In this paper, we propose \\textbf{TIE: a Training--Inversion--Exclusion} framework for visually interpretable and uncertainty-guided anomaly detection that jointly addresses these challenges through iterative refinement. TIE extends a standard $n$-class classifier to an $(n+1)$-class model by introducing a garbage class initialized with Gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. Within each epoch, TIE performs a closed-loop process of \\textit{training, inversion, and exclusion}, where highly uncertain inverted samples reconstructed from the just-trained classifier are excluded into the garbage class. Over successive iterations, the inverted samples transition from noisy artifacts into visually coherent class prototypes, providing transparent insight into how the model organizes its learned manifolds. During inference, TIE rejects OOD inputs by either directly mapping them to the garbage class or producing low-confidence, uncertain misclassifications within the in-distribution classes that are easily separable, all without relying on external OOD datasets. A comprehensive threshold-based evaluation using multiple OOD metrics and performance measures such as \\textit{AUROC}, \\textit{AUPR}, and \\textit{FPR@95\\%TPR} demonstrates that TIE offers a unified and interpretable framework for robust anomaly detection and calibrated uncertainty estimation (UE) achieving near-perfect OOD detection with \\textbf{\\(\\!\\approx\\!\\) 0 FPR@95\\%TPR} when trained on MNIST or FashionMNIST and tested against diverse unseen datasets."}

Adv. 10, eadp6388 (2024)], concatenated ${[[n,n-2,2]]}$ quantum error-detecting codes ($n$ is even), have recently been proposed as high-rate quantum codes suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the original many-hypercube codes with ${n=6}$ have large code block sizes at high concatenation levels (216 and 1296 physical qubits per block at levels 3 and 4, respectively), making not only experimental realization difficult but also logical error rates high. Toward earlier experimental realization and lower logical error rates, here we investigate smaller many-hypercube codes obtained by concatenating $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes, where, e.g., $D_{6,4,4}$ denotes the many-hypercube code using $[[6,4,2]]$ at level 1 and $[[4,2,2]]$ at levels 2 and 3. As a result, we found a surprising fact: $D_{6,4,4}$ ($D_{6,6,4,4}$) can achieve lower block error rates than $D_{4,4,4}$ ($D_{4,4,4,4}$), despite its higher encoding rate. Focusing on level 3, we also developed efficient fault-tolerant encoders realizing about 60% overhead reduction while maintaining or even improving the performance, compared to the original design. Using them, we numerically confirmed that $D_{6,4,4}$ also achieves the best performance for logical controlled-NOT gates in a circuit-level noise model.

To address this limitation, we propose a pretraining framework that exploits the information structure of a dynamical systems generative model across multiple time-series. This framework reveals our key insight that class identity can be efficiently captured by extracting information about the generative variables related to the system parameters shared across similar time series samples, while noise unique to individual samples should be discarded. Building on this insight, we propose PULSE, a cross-reconstruction-based pretraining objective for physiological time series datasets that explicitly extracts system information while discarding non-transferrable sample-specific ones. We establish theory that provides sufficient conditions for the system information to be recovered, and empirically validate it using a synthetic dynamical systems experiment. Furthermore, we apply our method to diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating that PULSE learns representations that can broadly distinguish semantic classes, increase label efficiency, and improve transfer learning."}

Using the geometric framework of Ref.~\\cite{GRP}, we analyse the intrinsic curvature of the associated energy--momentum surfaces, where negative curvature ensures hyperbolic and stable propagation, and curvature sign changes or critical points indicate kinematical instabilities or new invariant scales. We apply this method exhaustively to all major MDRs derived in LQG and find that they remain strictly hyperbolic in the entire phenomenologically relevant regime, with no elliptic patches or critical branching. The same framework provides universal constraints on representative logarithmic, exponential and trigonometric MDRs beyond EFT. Thus, geometric criteria yield a unified and coordinate-independent assessment of stability, thresholds and invariant scales, and demonstrate the robustness of MDRs emerging from LQG."}

To address these limitations, we introduce Polynomial Neural Sheaf Diffusion (PolyNSD), a new sheaf diffusion approach whose propagation operator is a degree-K polynomial in a normalised sheaf Laplacian, evaluated via a stable three-term recurrence on a spectrally rescaled operator. This provides an explicit K-hop receptive field in a single layer (independently of the stalk dimension), with a trainable spectral response obtained as a convex mixture of K+1 orthogonal polynomial basis responses. PolyNSD enforces stability via convex mixtures, spectral rescaling, and residual/gated paths, reaching new state-of-the-art results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks, inverting the Neural Sheaf Diffusion trend by obtaining these results with just diagonal restriction maps, decoupling performance from large stalk dimension, while reducing runtime and memory requirements."}

Conversely, RL agents excel in adaptability and learning, offering potential improvements in handling unforeseen situations, but suffer from significant challenges such as black-box decision-making processes and scalability issues in larger simulation environments. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) approach that synergizes the reliability and predictability of scripted agents with the dynamic, adaptive learning capabilities of RL. By structuring the AI system hierarchically, the proposed approach aims to utilize scripted agents for routine, tactical-level decisions and RL agents for higher-level, strategic decision-making, thus addressing the limitations of each method while leveraging their individual strengths.

In this system, electrons are trapped in vacuum above a solid neon film deposited on superconducting microwave resonators, where they exhibit strong coupling to the resonators, coherence times of ~0.1 ms, and single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.97%. A central challenge, however, is the spontaneous binding of electrons to neon surface bumps. These bumps, originating from substrate roughness, vary in size: electrons on bumps of suitable sizes within the resonator can couple to microwave photons and function as qubits, whereas those on unfavorable bumps remain inactive yet contribute to background charge noise. Moreover, both the bump landscape and the sites where electrons bind differ from run to run, leading to irreproducible qubit characteristics that hinder scalability. To address this challenging issue, we present an on-chip magnetic-levitation architecture in which arrays of solid-neon microparticles are suspended above the processor chip to act as electron carriers. This design eliminates substrate effects while retaining strong qubit-resonator coupling and supporting inter-qubit connectivity. Our analysis further shows that the qubit transition frequency can be tuned across the gigahertz range and its anharmonicity can reach ~0.8 GHz by tuning the resonator bias voltage.

In our work, we explore how this problem could be solved with an energy-based optimization method suitable for certain machines with non-von Neumann architectures. We used the Dirac-3, a device based on the entropy computing paradigm and made by Quantum Computing Inc., to evaluate our approach. Our formulations consist of (i) a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization model (QUBO, suitable for Ising machines) and a quartic formulation that allows for real-valued and integer variables (suitable for machines like the Dirac-3). Although current devices cannot solve large NMF problems, the results of our preliminary experiments are promising enough to warrant further research. For non-negative real matrices, we observed that a fusion approach of first using Dirac-3 and then feeding its results as the initial factor matrices to Scikit-learn's NMF procedure outperforms Scikit-learn's NMF procedure on its own, with default parameters in terms of the error in the reconstructed matrices. For our experiments on non-negative integer matrices, we compared the Dirac-3 device to Google's CP-SAT solver (inside the Or-Tools package) and found that for serial processing, Dirac-3 outperforms CP-SAT in a majority of the cases. We believe that future work in this area might be able to identify domains and variants of the problem where entropy computing (and other non-von Neumann architectures) could offer a clear advantage."}

We introduce the Sparse Variational GP-KAN (SVGP-KAN), an architecture that integrates sparse variational inference with the KAN topology. By employing $M$ inducing points and analytic moment matching, our method reduces computational complexity from $O(N^3)$ to $O(NM^2)$ or linear in sample size, enabling the application of probabilistic KANs to larger scientific datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that integrating a permutation-based importance analysis enables the network to function as a framework for structural identification, identifying relevant inputs and classifying functional relationships."}

This solution describes an asymmetric wormhole connecting two different asymptotically flat spacetimes (two universes) in which there are in general different observed masses and charges. It is shown that, by suitably adjusting the values of free system parameters, at one end of the wormhole, one can obtain the values of the observed mass and charge typical of the Standard Model particles, whereas at the other end of the wormhole these physical quantities acquire the Planck values.

However, it introduces privacy risks: an adversary with access to pre- and post-unlearning models can exploit their differences for membership inference or data reconstruction. We show these vulnerabilities arise from two factors: large gradient norms of forget-set samples and the close proximity of unlearned parameters to the original model. To demonstrate their severity, we propose unlearning-specific membership inference and reconstruction attacks, showing that several state-of-the-art methods (e.g., NGP, SCRUB) remain vulnerable. To mitigate this leakage, we introduce WARP, a plug-and-play teleportation defense that leverages neural network symmetries to reduce forget-set gradient energy and increase parameter dispersion while preserving predictions. This reparameterization obfuscates the signal of forgotten data, making it harder for attackers to distinguish forgotten samples from non-members or recover them via reconstruction. Across six unlearning algorithms, our approach achieves consistent privacy gains, reducing adversarial advantage (AUC) by up to 64% in black-box and 92% in white-box settings, while maintaining accuracy on retained data. These results highlight teleportation as a general tool for reducing attack success in approximate unlearning."}

We impose a general relativistic radiative transfer equation to determine the synchrotron emission from thermal electrons and generate horizon-scale images. In the RIAF-like model, we notice that the corresponding photon ring and central dark region are expanded with the aid of the PFDM parameter $η$, with brightness asymmetries originating at higher inclination angles and closely tied to flow dynamics and emission anisotropy. The fundamental difference between isotropic and anisotropic radiation is that anisotropy introduces vertical distortions in the higher-order images, resulting in an elliptical appearance. For the Hou disk model, the observed images produce narrower rings and dark interiors, while polarization patterns trace the brightness distribution and changes with the variations of the inclination angle and PFDM parameter $η$, which reflects the spacetime signature. All these results indicate that the observed intensity and polarization characteristics in the framework of thick disk models may serve as valuable probes of underlying spacetime geometry and the accretion-dynamics close to the horizon."}

While efforts have been made to transfer the success of the foundation models in general AI domains to biology, existing works focus on directly adopting the existing foundation model architectures from general machine learning domains without a systematic design considering the unique physicochemical and structural properties of each biological data modality. This leads to suboptimal performance, as these repurposed architectures struggle to capture the long-range dependencies, sparse information, and complex underlying ``grammars'' inherent to biological data. To address this gap, we introduce BioArc, a novel framework designed to move beyond intuition-driven architecture design towards principled, automated architecture discovery for biological foundation models. Leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), BioArc systematically explores a vast architecture design space, evaluating architectures across multiple biological modalities while rigorously analyzing the interplay between architecture, tokenization, and training strategies. This large-scale analysis identifies novel, high-performance architectures, allowing us to distill a set of empirical design principles to guide future model development. Furthermore, to make the best of this set of discovered principled architectures, we propose and compare several architecture prediction methods that effectively and efficiently predict optimal architectures for new biological tasks. Overall, our work provides a foundational resource and a principled methodology to guide the creation of the next generation of task-specific and foundation models for biology."}

High expressivity required for robust privacy induces exponentially large dynamical Lie algebras. This structure inevitably leads to barren plateaus. Conversely, trainable models restricted to polynomial-sized algebras remain transparent to algebraic attacks. To resolve this impasse, DyLoC is proposed. This dual-layer architecture employs an orthogonal decoupling strategy. Trainability is anchored to a polynomial-DLA ansatz while privacy is externalized to the input and output interfaces. Specifically, Truncated Chebyshev Graph Encoding (TCGE) is employed to thwart snapshot inversion. Dynamic Local Scrambling (DLS) is utilized to obfuscate gradients. Experiments demonstrate that DyLoC maintains baseline-level convergence with a final loss of 0.186. It outperforms the baseline by increasing the gradient reconstruction error by 13 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, snapshot inversion attacks are blocked when the reconstruction mean squared error exceeds 2.0. These results confirm that DyLoC effectively establishes a verifiable pathway for secure and trainable quantum machine learning."}

Physics-based vehicle models are often simplified for tractability and therefore exhibit inherent model-form uncertainty, motivating the need for data-driven correction. Moreover, non-autonomous dynamics are governed by time-dependent control inputs, which pose challenges in learning predictive models directly from temporal snapshot data. To address these, we reformulate the vehicle dynamics via a local parameterization of the time-dependent inputs, yielding a modified system composed of a sequence of local parametric dynamical systems. We approximate these parametric systems using two complementary approaches. First, we employ the DRIPS (dimension reduction and interpolation in parameter space) methodology to construct efficient linear surrogate models, equipped with lifted observable spaces and manifold-based operator interpolation. This enables data-efficient learning of vehicle models whose dynamics admit accurate linear representations in the lifted spaces. Second, for more strongly nonlinear systems, we employ FML (Flow Map Learning), a deep neural network approach that approximates the parametric evolution map without requiring special treatment of nonlinearities. We further extend FML with a transfer-learning-based model correction procedure, enabling the correction of misspecified prior models using only a sparse set of high-fidelity or experimental measurements, without assuming a prescribed form for the correction term. Through a suite of numerical experiments on unicycle, simplified bicycle, and slip-based bicycle models, we demonstrate that DRIPS offers robust and highly data-efficient learning of non-autonomous vehicle dynamics, while FML provides expressive nonlinear modeling and effective correction of model-form errors under severe data scarcity."}

The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers significant potential for this field, especially from the cross-modality aspect. Most methods adopt an LLM-as-Predictor paradigm, using LLM as the forecasting backbone and designing modality alignment mechanisms to enable LLM to understand time series data. However, the semantic information in the two modalities of time series and text differs significantly, making it challenging for LLM to fully understand time series data. To mitigate this challenge, our work follows an LLM-as-Enhancer paradigm to fully utilize the advantage of LLM in text understanding, where LLM is only used to encode text modality to complement time series modality. Based on this paradigm, we propose FiCoTS, an LLM-enhanced fine-to-coarse framework for multimodal time series forecasting. Specifically, the framework facilitates progressive cross-modality interaction by three levels in a fine-to-coarse scheme: First, in the token-level modality alignment module, a dynamic heterogeneous graph is constructed to filter noise and align time series patches with text tokens; Second, in the feature-level modality interaction module, a global cross-attention mechanism is introduced to enable each time series variable to connect with relevant textual contexts; Third, in the decision-level modality fusion module, we design a gated network to adaptively fuse the results of the two modalities for robust predictions. These three modules work synergistically to let the two modalities interact comprehensively across three semantic levels, enabling textual information to effectively support temporal prediction. Extensive experiments on seven real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The codes will be released publicly."}

Within this framework, accretion is studied while consistently accounting for the backreaction on the metric components. Using a perturbative approach, we derive an expression for the effective black hole mass and for the evolution of both the black hole and cosmological apparent horizons under accretion. The analysis is performed in two distinct cosmological regimes: first, a matter-dominated era, and subsequently, a de Sitter era. In both cases, it is possible to determine analytically the instant in which accretion begins. For the matter-dominated era, the analytical expression shows that the greater the amount of matter available for accretion, the longer the accretion takes to start."}

To demonstrate this, we analyze the loss landscapes of random quantum neural networks constructed out of Hilbert space fragmented systems. We prove that in this setting, it is possible to eliminate barren plateaus and poor local minima, suggesting efficient trainability when using gradient descent. Furthermore, as the algebra defining the fragmentation is not known a priori and not guaranteed to have sparse algebra elements, to the best of our knowledge there are no existing efficient classical algorithms generally capable of simulating expectation values in these networks.

Leveraging on balance theory that deduces edge signs from multi-hop node pairs, signed graph learning can generate node embeddings that preserve both structural and sign information. However, training on sensitive signed graphs raises significant privacy concerns, as model parameters may leak private link information. Existing protection methods with differential privacy (DP) typically rely on edge or gradient perturbation for unsigned graph protection. Yet, they are not well-suited for signed graphs, mainly because edge perturbation tends to cascading errors in edge sign inference under balance theory, while gradient perturbation increases sensitivity due to node interdependence and gradient polarity change caused by sign flips, resulting in larger noise injection. In this paper, motivated by the robustness of adversarial learning to noisy interactions, we present ASGL, a privacy-preserving adversarial signed graph learning method that preserves high utility while achieving node-level DP. We first decompose signed graphs into positive and negative subgraphs based on edge signs, and then design a gradient-perturbed adversarial module to approximate the true signed connectivity distribution. In particular, the gradient perturbation helps mitigate cascading errors, while the subgraph separation facilitates sensitivity reduction. Further, we devise a constrained breadth-first search tree strategy that fuses with balance theory to identify the edge signs between generated node pairs. This strategy also enables gradient decoupling, thereby effectively lowering gradient sensitivity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that ASGL achieves favorable privacy-utility trade-offs across multiple downstream tasks."}

Here, we show that, in addition to Hamiltonian locality, a key structural property, g-extensiveness, quantifying the distribution of interaction energy across lattice sites places a fundamental bound on charging performance in spin-lattice models. We prove that superextensive power scaling is possible only when the interaction-energy distribution becomes increasingly nonuniform, with the maximal local weight growing with system size. This criterion explains why many previously studied protocols fail to exhibit superextensive power, even when the Hamiltonians involve large participation numbers. We further demonstrate that this condition is realized in an experimentally relevant interacting model, where, despite fixed interaction order, the charging power scales superextensively. Our results establish g-extensiveness as a necessary resource for quantum advantage in direct-charging protocols and provide a systematic framework for identifying and engineering physically feasible quantum batteries capable of outperforming classical counterparts in charging power."}

In this work, we develop a formalism to study the geometry of \\textit{general} horizons (i.e. characterized by any $\\mathcal{K}$), based on encoding the zeroth and first transverse derivatives of $\\mathcal{K}$ on null hypersurfaces detached from any ambient spacetime. We introduce the notions of \\textit{$\\mathcal{K}$-tuple} and \\textit{non-isolation tensor}. The former encodes the order zero of $\\mathcal{K}$, while the latter is a symmetric $2$-covariant tensor that codifies the ``degree of isolation\" of a horizon. In particular, the non-isolation tensor vanishes for homothetic, Killing and isolated horizons. As an application we derive a \\textit{generalized near-horizon equation}, i.e., an identity that holds on any horizon (regardless of its topology or whether it contains fixed points), which relates the non-isolation tensor, a certain torsion one-form, and curvature terms. By restricting this equation to a cross-section one can recover the near-horizon equation of isolated horizons and the master equation of multiple Killing horizons. Our formalism allows us to prove two existence theorems for horizons. Specifically, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a non-degenerate totally geodesic horizon with any prescribed non-isolation tensor to be embeddable in a spacetime satisfying any (non-necessarily $Λ$-vacuum) field equations. We treat first the case of arbitrary topology, and then show how the result can be strengthened when the horizon admits a cross-section."}

We provide analytical results that are valid for any functional value of the frequency and along the whole evolution of the TDHO, which allows us to monitor the behavior of the thermodynamical magnitudes in regions that are not fully considered in previous works, i.e. the transition and the non quasi-static regions. We supplement the analytical results with numerical calculations and graphs.\n  They both show how the largest modes of the non invariant representations may undergo a process of reversible thermalization, where the concept of temperature naturally arises from the unitary evolution of the oscillator with no relation to any external concept of temperature. It would allow us to monitor an unexpected classical-to-quantum transition, which might entail a violation of the third principle of classical thermodynamics. We also provide adaptations of the customary definitions of the quantum heat and work that account for the particle creation of the TDHO. They thus depend on the representation and their evolution is different for the three representations analyzed in this paper, which might have important consequences in the development of quantum thermal machines. Finally, we study the relationship between the creation of particles and the diagonal entropy, which is derived from the von Neumann entropy in the diagonalization limit. The condition of no production of entropy under unitary evolution suggests the definition of a mode temperature that would correspond to the thermal temperature is some appropriate limit."}

The features of the rays near the photon spheres in not only black hole spacetimes but also exotic spacetimes would be important since one will need them to exclude black-hole mimickers. The deflection angles of the rays deflected by photon spheres diverge logarithmically and we can treat them by a strong-deflection-limit analysis. The error of the strong-deflection-limit analysis becomes large if antiphoton spheres exist in the spacetimes and the analysis breaks down when the photon spheres and the antiphoton spheres degenerate to form a marginally unstable photon sphere. This is because the deflection angles of the rays bent by the marginally unstable photon sphere diverge in powers. In this paper, we extend Eiroa, Romero, and Torres's method to gravitational lensing of rays inside and outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a general, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically-flat spacetime in strong deflection limits and we apply it to a Reissner-Nordström spacetime and a Hayward spacetime with the marginally unstable photon sphere.

In this work, we investigate multiqubit Rydberg gates that are useful for fault-tolerant quantum error correction in single-species neutral-atom platforms and can be implemented with a single, non-addressed laser pulse. We develop an open-source Python package to generate analytical, few-parameter pulses that implement the desired gates while minimizing gate errors due to Rydberg-state decay. The tool also allows us to identify parameter-optimal pulses, characterized by a minimal parameter count for the pulse ansatz. Measurement-free quantum error correction protocols require CCZ gates, which we analyze for atoms arranged in symmetric and asymmetric configurations. We investigate the performance of these schemes for various single-, two-, and three-qubit gate error rates, showing that break-even performance of measurement-free QEC is within reach of current hardware. Moreover, we study Floquet quantum error correction protocols that comprise two-body stabilizer measurements. Those can be realized using global three-qubit gates, and we show that this can lead to a significant reduction in shuttling operations.

In these systems, effects such as coherence, entanglement, and non-Markovianity play key roles. In this thesis, we explore different ways to describe quantum thermodynamics, using two main approaches: one based on entropy and the other on ergotropy. First, we introduce a generalized approach to quantify non-Markovianity through the breakdown of monotonicity in thermodynamic functions. In this context, the entropy-based heat flow serves as a practical tool to witness and measure quantum memory in unital maps that do not reverse the sign of the internal energy. Next, we analyze the dynamics of ergotropy in open qubits under both Markovian and non-Markovian evolutions. We identify phenomena such as freezing and sudden death of ergotropy, and we establish an analytical relation between the change in ergotropy and the environment-induced work . This provides a clear physical interpretation for the additional term in the first law in the entropy-based formulation. Finally, we propose an ergotropy-based thermodynamic formulation, in which heat is reinterpreted in terms of the change of the passive state associated with the density operator governing the quantum dynamics. This approach allows one to measure non-Markovianity of unital maps more generally and accurately than the entropy-based heat flow.

Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a key technique for creating lightweight student models, with recent advances like frequency-aware KD successfully preserving spectral properties (i.e., high-frequency details and low-frequency trends). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by operating on pixel-level signals, leaving them blind to the rich semantic and causal context behind the visual patterns. To overcome this limitation, we introduce S^2-KD, a novel framework that unifies Semantic priors with Spectral representations for distillation. Our approach begins by training a privileged, multimodal teacher model. This teacher leverages textual narratives from a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) to reason about the underlying causes of events, while its architecture simultaneously decouples spectral components in its latent space. The core of our framework is a new distillation objective that transfers this unified semantic-spectral knowledge into a lightweight, vision-only student. Consequently, the student learns to make predictions that are not only spectrally accurate but also semantically coherent, without requiring any textual input or architectural overhead at inference. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like WeatherBench and TaxiBJ+ show that S^2-KD significantly boosts the performance of simple student models, enabling them to outperform state-of-the-art methods, particularly in long-horizon and complex non-stationary scenarios."}

During quantum information scrambling, localized quantum information disperses across the entire system, hiding from the observers who can only access part of it. On the other side, we have a fundamental cryptographic primitive called secret-sharing schemes, where a dealer shares a quantum secret with a group of parties, such that any subset of parties above a specific threshold size can reconstruct it. In this paper, we demonstrate that two protocols, Haar scrambling, which serves as a baseline for other scrambling techniques, and quantum secret sharing, are indeed equivalent. The scheme one gets out of this is of a ramp secret-sharing nature rather than a threshold scheme. We expect this because of the inherent randomness present in Haar unitaries. Moreover, by varying the purity of the initial states, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain all possible types of ramp secret-sharing schemes. Furthermore, utilizing complexity theoretic arguments, we argue that the protocol can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in polynomial time. Finally, we explore potential applications, ranging from security implications for distributed quantum networks to cryptography in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, and draw insights for fundamental physics, such as many-body physics and quantum black holes."}

The large-scale training data allows PrexSyn to reconstruct the synthesizable chemical space nearly perfectly at a high inference speed and learn the association between properties and synthesizable molecules. Based on its learned property-pathway mappings, PrexSyn can generate synthesizable molecules that satisfy not only single-property conditions but also composite property queries joined by logical operators, thereby allowing users to ``program'' generation objectives. Moreover, by exploiting this property-based querying capability, PrexSyn can efficiently optimize molecules against black-box oracle functions via iterative query refinement, achieving higher sampling efficiency than even synthesis-agnostic baselines, making PrexSyn a powerful general-purpose molecular optimization tool.

In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that explains this phenomenon through the lens of hidden convexity and overparameterization. We identify sufficient conditions - spanning initialization, training dynamics, and network width - that guarantee global convergence to a NE in a broad class of non-convex min-max games. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for games that involve two-layer neural networks. Technically, our approach is twofold: (a) we derive a novel path-length bound for the alternating gradient descent-ascent scheme in min-max games; and (b) we show that the reduction from a hidden convex-concave geometry to two-sided Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PŁ) min-max condition hold with high probability under overparameterization, using tools from random matrix theory."}

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining parameters through strategies such as parameter decomposition, coefficient optimization, and subspace learning, significantly reducing the need for expensive joint training and achieving strong empirical performance across diverse tasks. However, these approaches predominantly treat merging as a problem of parameter space decomposition or fusion coefficient optimization, while overlooking the critical role of directional information in both parameter and feature spaces. In practice, naïve merging introduces inconsistencies in dominant parameter directions and disrupts structural coherence across models, which can degrade performance. Moreover, coefficient-based optimization methods implicitly assume compatible feature-space directions across models. However, Neural Collapse indicates that class features follow structured directional patterns, which may differ across independently trained models, making coefficient optimization alone insufficient.

In the case of a massive entropic environment, the attractor Bunch--Davies vacuum plays a special role: it is the only state that can undergo full recoherence, whereas all excited initial states exhibit persistent loss of purity. To characterize this behavior, we parameterize excited Gaussian initial states by their Bogoliubov coefficients and compute the purity and Rényi-2 entropy of the reduced adiabatic state as information-theoretic indicators of decoherence dynamics. We find that excited states display \\emph{purity-freezing} at a non-zero plateau, where residual quantum correlations persist indefinitely, a qualitative departure from the complete recoherence observed for the Bunch--Davies vacuum.

For this reason, Richard Feynman proposed the concept of a quantum simulator: quantum systems engineered to obey a prescribed evolution equation and repeating the experiment multiple times. Experimentally, however, as we explain below, the vast majority of observables describing the system are inaccessible. Thus, while Feynman's idea addresses the problem of simulating quantum dynamics, it leaves unsolved the equally fundamental problem of inferring the underlying physics from the limited observables accessible in experiments. Indeed, many complex phenomena associated with QMB systems remain elusive. Perhaps, the most important example is identifying phase transitions in QMB systems when no simple order-parameter exists, which poses major challenges to this day. Complicating the problem further is the fact that, in most cases, it is impossible to learn from numerical simulations, as the underlying systems are often too large to be computable, and small QMB can show strong finite size effects, masking the presence of the transition. Here, we present an unsupervised machine learning approach to study QMB experiments, specifically aimed at detecting phase transitions and crossovers directly from raw experimental measurements. We demonstrate our methodology on systems undergoing Many-Body Localization cross-over and Mott-to-Superfluid phase-transition, showing that it reveals collective phenomena from the very partial experimental data and without any model-specific prior knowledge of the system.

Much of this discrepancy is attributed to the difficulty in discriminating ETPA from various background processes that can mimic its signal, such as linear absorption or scattering. Given this need to certify the presence of ETPA unequivocally, this work introduces a key strategy to isolate the ETPA contribution through its spectral signature. This involves modeling the molecule as a two-photon notch filter and inducing a controlled asymmetric overlap with the joint spectral intensity (JSI) of the incident photons. This asymmetry is used to generate a measurable distortion in the transmitted JSI, and, complementarily, as a reduction in the visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip. To ensure the experimental feasibility of this technique, a comprehensive analysis of the experimental conditions required for its detection is presented, establishing the absorption efficiency limits that must be overcome given the constraints of entangled-photon-pair flux and detector noise. A preliminary experiment addressing the ETPA detection limits using the standard RhB dye is presented."}

Stringent data protection regulations limit access to clinical records for training and integrating machine learning models that have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and personalized care outcomes.

In this paper, we enhance a state-of-the-art time-series generative model to better handle longitudinal clinical data while incorporating quantifiable privacy safeguards. Using real data from chronic kidney disease and ICU patients, we evaluate our method through statistical tests, a Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real (TSTR) setup, and expert clinical review. Our non-private model (Augmented TimeGAN) outperforms transformer- and flow-based models on statistical metrics in several datasets, while our private model (DP-TimeGAN) maintains a mean authenticity of 0.778 on the CKD dataset, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models on the privacy-utility frontier. Both models achieve performance comparable to real data in clinician evaluations, providing robust input data necessary for developing models for complex chronic conditions without compromising data privacy."}

Existing fairness methods are predominantly classification-oriented and fail to extend to continuous outputs, making a unified fairness objective difficult to formulate. Further, existing MTL optimization is structurally misaligned with fairness: constraining only the shared representation, allowing task heads to absorb bias and leading to uncontrolled task-specific disparities. Finally, most work treats fairness as a zero-sum trade-off with utility, enforcing symmetric constraints that achieve parity by degrading well-served groups. We introduce FairMT, a unified fairness-aware MTL framework that accommodates all three task types under incomplete supervision. At its core is an Asymmetric Heterogeneous Fairness Constraint Aggregation mechanism, which consolidates task-dependent asymmetric violations into a unified fairness constraint. Utility and fairness are jointly optimized via a primal--dual formulation, while a head-aware multi-objective optimization proxy provides a tractable descent geometry that explicitly accounts for head-induced anisotropy.

One existing study pointed out that dynamic reordering worsens the simulation time and numerical accuracy, and there is no comprehensive research on static orders in the context of quantum circuit simulation. Therefore, this paper proposes a scoring-based heuristic method for determining a static variable order that enables efficient DD-based quantum circuit simulation.

The Liouvillian exceptional point (LEP), involving the interplay of energy loss and decoherence inherently relevant to quantum jumps, has recently drawn much attention due to capability to fully capture quantum system dynamics and naturally facilitate non-Hermitian quantum investigations. It was also predicted that quantum jumps could give rise to third-order LEPs in two-level quantum systems for its high dimensional Liouvillian superoperator, which, however, has never been experimentally confirmed until now. Here we report the first observation of the third-order LEPs emerging from quantum jumps in an ultracold two-level trapped-ion system. Moreover, by combining decay with dephasing processes, we present the first experimental exploration of LEPs involving combinatorial effect of decay and dephasing. In particular, due to non-commutativity between the Lindblad superoperators governing LEPs for decay and dephasing, we witness the movement of LEPs driven by the competition between decay and dephasing occurring in an open quantum system. This unique feature of non-Hermitian quantum systems paves a new avenue for modifying nonreciprocity, enhancing precision measurement, and manipulating topological dynamics by tuning the LEPs."}

To support this, we performed quantum information modeling and fidelity simulations for the cross-aligned PMF pair, and experimentally compared the entanglement preservation and interference fringe stability in setups based on standard single-mode fibers (SMFs) and PMFs. The experimental results show that the PMF-based configuration achieves an average visibility of 0.867 and an error propagation of 0.023 under unstable conditions, whereas the SMF setup exhibits a significantly lower stability with an average visibility of 0.444 and an error propagation of 0.167 under the same conditions.

However, existing hierarchical clustering methods encounter two primary challenges: 1) Most methods specify dendrograms without a global objective. 2) Graph-based methods often neglect the significance of graph structure, optimizing objectives on complete or static predefined graphs. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Continuous Structural Entropy neural networks, namely HypCSE, for structure-enhanced continuous hierarchical clustering. Our key idea is to map data points in the hyperbolic space and minimize the relaxed continuous structural entropy (SE) on structure-enhanced graphs. Specifically, we encode graph vertices in hyperbolic space using hyperbolic graph neural networks and minimize approximate SE defined on graph embeddings. To make the SE objective differentiable for optimization, we reformulate it into a function using the lowest common ancestor (LCA) on trees and then relax it into continuous SE (CSE) by the analogy of hyperbolic graph embeddings and partitioning trees. To ensure a graph structure that effectively captures the hierarchy of data points for CSE calculation, we employ a graph structure learning (GSL) strategy that updates the graph structure during training. Extensive experiments on seven datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HypCSE."}

In this work, we develop and analyze an efficient dataset distillation algorithm for supervised learning, specifically regression in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, based on matching the losses on the training and synthetic datasets with respect to a fixed set of randomly sampled regressors without any model training. Our first key contribution is a novel performance guarantee proving that our algorithm needs only $\\tilde{O}(d^2)$ sampled regressors to derive a synthetic dataset on which the MSE loss of any bounded linear model is nearly the same as its MSE loss on the given training data. In particular, the model optimized on the synthetic data has close to minimum loss on the training data, thus performing nearly as well as the model optimized on the latter. Complementing this, we also prove a matching lower bound of $Ω(d^2)$ for the number of sampled regressors showing the tightness of our analysis.\n  Our second contribution is to extend our algorithm to offline RL dataset distillation by matching the Bellman loss, unlike previous works which used a behavioral cloning objective. This is the first such method which leverages both, the rewards and the next state information, available in offline RL datasets, without any policy model optimization. Our algorithm generates a synthetic dataset whose Bellman loss with respect to any linear action-value predictor is close to the latter's Bellman loss on the offline RL training dataset. Therefore, a policy associated with an action-value predictor optimized on the synthetic dataset performs nearly as well as that derived from the one optimized on the training data.

However, real-world social networks have several structural inequalities, such as dominant majority groups and underrepresented minority groups. If these inequalities are not considered while designing IM algorithms, the outcomes might be biased, disproportionately benefiting majority groups while marginalizing minorities. In this work, we address this gap by designing a fairness-aware IM method using Reinforcement Learning (RL) that ensures equitable influence outreach across all communities, regardless of protected attributes. Fairness is incorporated using a maximin fairness objective, which prioritizes improving the outreach of the least-influenced group, pushing the solution toward an equitable influence distribution. We propose a novel fairness-aware deep RL method, called DQ4FairIM, that maximizes the expected number of influenced nodes by learning an RL policy. The learnt policy ensures that minority groups formulate the IM problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use deep Q-learning, combined with the Structure2Vec network embedding, earning together with Structure2Vec network embedding to solve the MDP. We perform extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world networks to compare our method with fairness-agnostic and fairness-aware baselines. The results show that our method achieves a higher level of fairness while maintaining a better fairness-performance trade-off than baselines.

We address this challenge by reframing MIE detection as a data-driven learning problem that assumes no prior knowledge of state preparation. Using measurement records alone, we train a neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict the uncertainty metric for MIE--the gap between upper and lower bounds of the average post-measurement bipartite entanglement. Applied to random circuits with one-dimensional all-to-all connectivity and two-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupling, our method reveals a learnability transition with increasing circuit depth: below a threshold, the uncertainty is small and decreases with polynomial measurement data and model parameters, while above it the uncertainty remains large despite increasing resources. We further verify this transition experimentally on current noisy quantum devices, demonstrating its robustness to realistic noise. These results highlight the power of data-driven approaches for learning MIE and delineate the practical limits of its classical learnability."}

To formally address this issue, we study \\emph{list replicability} in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) RL framework, where an algorithm must return a near-optimal policy that lies in a \\emph{small list} of policies across different runs, with high probability. The size of this list defines the \\emph{list complexity}. We introduce both weak and strong forms of list replicability: the weak form ensures that the final learned policy belongs to a small list, while the strong form further requires that the entire sequence of executed policies remains constrained. These objectives are challenging, as existing RL algorithms exhibit exponential list complexity due to their instability. Our main theoretical contribution is a provably efficient tabular RL algorithm that guarantees list replicability by ensuring the list complexity remains polynomial in the number of states, actions, and the horizon length. We further extend our techniques to achieve strong list replicability, bounding the number of possible policy execution traces polynomially with high probability. Our theoretical result is made possible by key innovations including (i) a novel planning strategy that selects actions based on lexicographic order among near-optimal choices within a randomly chosen tolerance threshold, and (ii) a mechanism for testing state reachability in stochastic environments while preserving replicability. Finally, we demonstrate that our theoretical investigation sheds light on resolving the \\emph{instability} issue of RL algorithms used in practice.

To address this, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detector (ESPD) framework, a novel paradigm for achieving high-performance SPDs through the iterative enhancement of low-technology SPDs. Utilizing only standard quantum optical components, the ESPD scheme transforms a legacy non-superconducting SPD, with detection efficiency (DE) about $59\\%$ and dark count rate (DCR) $10^{-2}$, into a device with superior performance metrics, achieving DE higher than $95\\%$ and DCR below $10^{-9}$.

Another is that there are clear axes of difficulty--e.g., more complex geometries and higher Reynolds numbers--along which problems become (1) harder for classical solvers and thus (2) more likely to benefit from neural speedups. Towards addressing this chicken-and-egg challenge, we study difficulty transfer on 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes, systematically varying task complexity along geometry (number and placement of obstacles), physics (Reynolds number), and their combination. Similar to how it is possible to spend compute to pre-train foundation models and improve their performance on downstream tasks, we find that by classically solving (analogously pre-generating) many low and medium difficulty examples and including them in the training set, it is possible to learn high-difficulty physics from far fewer samples. Furthermore, we show that by combining low and high difficulty data, we can spend 8.9x less compute on pre-generating a dataset to achieve the same error as using only high difficulty examples. Our results highlight that how we allocate classical-solver compute across difficulty levels is as important as how much we allocate overall, and suggest substantial gains from principled curation of pre-generated PDE data for neural solvers.

While pharmaceutical R&D is plagued by high attrition rates and enormous costs, particularly within neuroscience, where success rates are below 10%, timely identification of promising programs can streamline resource allocation and reduce financial risk. Leveraging data from the ClinicalTrials.gov database and success labels from the recently developed Clinical Trial Outcome dataset, the classifier extracts text-based clinical trial features using statistical NLP techniques. These features were integrated into several non-LLM frameworks (logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest) to generate calibrated probability scores. Model performance was assessed on a retrospective dataset of 101,145 completed clinical trials spanning 1976-2024, achieving an overall ROC-AUC of 0.64. An LLM-based predictive model was then built using BioBERT, a domain-specific language representation encoder. The BioBERT-based model achieved an overall ROC-AUC of 0.74 and a Brier Score of 0.185, indicating its predictions had, on average, 40% less squared error than would be observed using industry benchmarks. The BioBERT-based model also made trial outcome predictions that were superior to benchmark values 70% of the time overall.

Many existing fairness approaches rely on coarse demographic adjustments or post-hoc corrections, which fail to capture the latent structure of clinical populations and may unintentionally reinforce bias. We propose FAIR-MTL, a fairness-aware multitask learning framework designed to provide equitable and fine-grained prediction of postoperative complication severity.\n  Instead of relying on explicit sensitive attributes during model training, FAIR-MTL employs a data-driven subgroup inference mechanism. We extract a compact demographic embedding, and apply k-means clustering to uncover latent patient subgroups that may be differentially affected by traditional models. These inferred subgroup labels determine task routing within a shared multitask architecture. During training, subgroup imbalance is mitigated through inverse-frequency weighting, and regularization prevents overfitting to smaller groups.\n  Applied to postoperative complication prediction with four severity levels, FAIR-MTL achieves an AUC of 0.86 and an accuracy of 75%, outperforming single-task baselines while substantially reducing bias. For gender, the demographic parity difference decreases to 0.055 and equalized odds to 0.094; for age, these values reduce to 0.056 and 0.148, respectively. Model interpretability is ensured through SHAP and Gini importance analyses, which consistently highlight clinically meaningful predictors such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, and patient weight. Our findings show that incorporating unsupervised subgroup discovery into a multitask framework enables more equitable, interpretable, and clinically actionable predictions for surgical risk stratification."}

However, QRL policies face uncertainty from quantum measurements and hardware noise, such as bit-flip, phase-flip, and depolarizing errors, which can lead to unsafe behavior. Existing work offers no systematic way to verify whether trained QRL policies meet safety requirements under specific noise conditions.\n  We introduce QVerifier, a formal verification method that applies probabilistic model checking to analyze trained QRL policies with and without modeled quantum noise. QVerifier builds a complete model of the policy-environment interaction, incorporates quantum uncertainty directly into the transition probabilities, and then checks safety properties using the Storm model checker.\n  Experiments across multiple QRL environments show that QVerifier precisely measures how different noise models influence safety, revealing both performance degradation and cases where noise can help. By enabling rigorous safety verification before deployment, QVerifier addresses a critical need: because access to quantum hardware is expensive, pre-deployment verification is essential for any safety-critical use of QRL. QVerifier targets a potential classical-quantum sweet spot: trained QRL policies that execute efficiently on quantum hardware, yet remain tractable for classical probabilistic model checking despite being too slow for real-time classical deployment."}

To adapt this model, we apply Noisy Embedding Instruction Finetuning and based on our previous work, this method increases robustness by injecting controlled noise into the embedding layers during supervised adaptation. We improve efficiency further with Rank-stabilized Low-Rank Adaptation low-rank optimization approach, and FlashAttention, which allow for faster training with lower GPU memory.

As the Standard Model (SM) leaves key questions unanswered and no signs of new physics have emerged since the Higgs boson discovery, advanced experimental and computational tools become necessary. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative to classical methods, and this work investigates three main avenues where quantum algorithms can be useful in HEP research. First, we develop quantum subroutines for computing Minkowski distances and identifying maximum values in unsorted data, inserting them into clustering algorithms such as $k$-means, Affinity Propagation, and $k_T$-jet clustering. These quantum algorithms match classical performance while offering theoretical advantages when implemented on quantum hardware with qRAM. Then, we introduce a novel quantum Monte Carlo integrator, Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), which combines a quantum neural network with amplitude estimation to integrate multivariate functions. QFIAE is executed on simulators and real quantum computers to evaluate Feynman loop integrals via Loop-Tree Duality, and is extended to compute (partially on hardware) a physical observable at NLO in perturbative quantum field theory. Finally, we present Quantum Chebyshev Probabilistic Models (QCPMs) for modeling multivariate distributions, applying them to fragmentation functions of partons fragmenting into kaons and pions. These models demonstrate accurate generative and interpolation capabilities. We also show how entanglement between variables plays a key role in training, enhancing model accuracy. Overall, these results show how quantum algorithms can already tackle relevant HEP problems on current hardware, while paving the way for future fault-tolerant applications that fully exploit quantum computational advantages."}

These agents must orchestrate complex sequences of data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization, tasks that require sophisticated planning and iteration. While recent work on building ML agents has explored using large language models (LLMs) for direct code generation, tool-augmented approaches offer greater modularity and reliability. However, existing tool-use benchmarks focus primarily on task-specific tool selection or argument extraction for tool invocation, failing to evaluate the sophisticated planning capabilities required for ML Agents. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented ML agents using a curated set of 61 specialized tools and 15 tabular ML challenges from Kaggle. Our benchmark goes beyond traditional tool-use evaluation by incorporating an in-memory named object management, allowing agents to flexibly name, save, and retrieve intermediate results throughout the workflows. We demonstrate that standard ReAct-style approaches struggle to generate valid tool sequences for complex ML pipelines, and that tree search methods with LLM-based evaluation underperform due to inconsistent state scoring. To address these limitations, we propose two simple approaches: 1) using shaped deterministic rewards with structured textual feedback, and 2) decomposing the original problem into a sequence of sub-tasks, which significantly improves trajectory validity and task performance. Using GPT-4o, our approach improves over ReAct by 16.52 percentile positions, taking the median across all Kaggle challenges.

We take the self testing for the polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states as an example. The self testing is based on the violation of two-dimension CHSH test in each DOF independently. The two-step swap isometry circuits are proposed for self testing the entanglement in spatial-mode and polarization DOFs, respectively. All the sixteen polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states can be self tested. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework has three advantages. First, it is a general hyperentanglement self testing framework, and can be extended to self test multi-DOF hyperentanglement and multipartite hyperentanglement. Second, it can provide the robust hyperentanglement self testing and establish the relation between the lower bound of fidelity and the imperfect violation of Bell-like inequality in each DOF. Third, it is feasible with current experimental technology. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework provides a promising way to certify complex hyperentanglement sources, and has potential application in future high-capacity quantum network."}

While diffusion models have set recent benchmarks, flow matching (FM) offers a promising alternative. This paper presents different ways to implement flow matching for tabular data synthesis. We provide a comprehensive empirical study that compares flow matching (FM and variational FM) with a state-of-the-art diffusion method (TabDDPM and TabSyn) in tabular data synthesis. We evaluate both the standard Optimal Transport (OT) and the Variance Preserving (VP) probability paths, and also compare deterministic and stochastic samplers -- something possible when learning to generate using \\textit{variational} flow matching -- characterising the empirical relationship between data utility and privacy risk. Our key findings reveal that flow matching, particularly TabbyFlow, outperforms diffusion baselines. Flow matching methods also achieves better performance with remarkably low function evaluations ($\\leq$ 100 steps), offering a substantial computational advantage. The choice of probability path is also crucial, as using the OT path demonstrates superior performance, while VP has potential for producing synthetic data with lower disclosure risk. Lastly, our results show that making flows stochastic not only preserves marginal distributions but, in some instances, enables the generation of high utility synthetic data with reduced disclosure risk."}

Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based reward models can enhance discriminative capability, they typically introduce substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an upcycle and merge MoE reward modeling approach. We first upcycle a dense reward model into a MoE architecture, where a shared expert captures general knowledge, while normal experts specialize in instruction-specific patterns. We then apply routing-weight normalization and merge experts back into a dense model through a learnable weight-averaging mechanism, preserving performance gains while significantly reducing inference cost. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates reward hacking across various model scales.

However, directly using MLLM output for clustering has risks for producing unstructured and generic image descriptions instead of feature-specific and concrete ones. To address these issues, our method first discovers that MLLMs' hidden states of text tokens are strongly related to the corresponding features, and leverages these embeddings to perform clusterings from any user-defined criteria. We also employ a lightweight clustering head augmented with pseudo-label learning, significantly enhancing clustering accuracy.

In this paper, we present a construction of the time-evolution operator, as a projected entangled pair operator (denoted tePEPO), that can be used to evolve a tensor network ansatz through time. Interactions beyond nearest-neighbor, including interactions between sites not collinear in the lattice, can be represented efficiently as a tePEPO. Furthermore, we obtain approximations to realistic radial long-range interactions decaying with a power-law, that give accurate results with small tePEPO bond dimension. Finally, we consider a physical example of a Rydberg atom Hamiltonian with long-range dipolar interactions, and show evidence of a dipole-dipole blockading effect in presence of dissipation.

In this study, we present a hybrid modelling framework that integrates policy-aware fertility functions into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) enhanced with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture physical constraints and temporal dependencies in population dynamics. The model is applied to India's age structured population from 2024 to 2054 under three fertility-policy scenarios: continuation of current fertility decline, stricter population control, and relaxed fertility promotion. The governing transport-reaction partial differential equation is formulated with India-specific demographic indicators, including age-specific fertility and mortality rates. PINNs embed the core population equation and policy-driven fertility changes, while LSTM layers improve long-term forecasting across decades. Results show that fertility policies substantially shape future age distribution, dependency ratios, and workforce size. Stricter controls intensify ageing and reduce labour force participation, whereas relaxed policies support workforce growth but increase population pressure. Our findings suggest that the hybrid LSTM-PINN is an effective approach for demographic forecasting, offering accuracy with interpretability.

Through the use of the Medical Conversations to Disease Dataset which contains 960 multi-turn dialogues divided into 24 Clinical Conditions, a standardised representation of conversations between patient and bot is created for further analysis by computational means. The multi-method approach uses a variety of tools, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify latent symptom themes, K-Means to group symptom descriptions by similarity, Transformer-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract medical concepts, and the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent symptom pairs. Findings from the analysis indicate a coherent structure of clinically relevant topics, moderate levels of clustering cohesiveness and several high confidence rates on the relationships between symptoms like fever headache and rash itchiness. The results support the notion that conversational medical data can be a valuable diagnostic signal for early symptom interpretation, assist in strengthening decision support and improve how users interact with tele-health technology. By demonstrating a method for converting unstructured free-flowing dialogue into actionable knowledge regarding symptoms this work provides an extensible framework to further enhance future performance, dependability and clinical utility of selecting medical chatbots."}

Several source extraction programs, including SoFiA and Aegean, have been developed to address this challenge. However, finding optimal parameter configurations when applying these programs to real observations is non-trivial. For example, the outcomes of SoFiA intensely depend on several key parameters across its preconditioning, source-finding, and reliability-filtering modules. To address this issue, we propose a framework to automatically optimize these parameters using an AI agent based on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, i.e., Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The SKA Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset is utilized to assess the feasibility and reliability of this framework. The AI agent interacts with the environment by adjusting parameters based on the feedback from the SDC2 score defined by the SDC2 Team, progressively learning to select parameter sets that yield improved performance. After sufficient training, the AI agent can automatically identify an optimal parameter configuration that outperform the benchmark set by Team SoFiA within only 100 evaluation steps and with reduced time consumption. Our approach could address similar problems requiring complex parameter tuning, beyond radio band surveys and source extraction. Yet, high-quality training sets containing representative observations and catalogs of ground truth are essential."}

A common belief is that DPO is supervised learning while PPO is reinforcement learning, yet deeper analyses for the reasons underlying these differences remain lacking. To fill this gap, we analyze their optimization dynamics, revealing distinct algorithmic behaviors and comprehending their underlying causes. First, we examine the target directions of gradient-based updates and find that DPO follows stable targets, whereas PPO follows dynamic targets that balance exploration and exploitation, thus validating the common belief from a new perspective. Second, we examine the roles of positive learning, negative learning, and loss reweighting, which are three key components in PO methods. Our analyses reveal that these components play fairly different roles. In DPO, positive and negative learning jointly shape the learning targets meanwhile mutually offset each other. However, loss reweighting in DPO acts less as a reward signal but more as a regularizer to mitigate overfitting. In PPO, negative learning primarily supports exploration rather than determining the targets. Meanwhile, loss reweighting, related to absolute values of token-level advantages, indicates the distinct roles of token groups in updating targets. Given these findings, we conduct carefully designed ablation studies to further examine how controlling these dynamics impacts optimization efficiency and practical performance. The insights gained from our analyses not only deepen the understanding of PO methods but also inspire the development of more preference-aligned LLMs."}

However, most reversible BCD adders focus primarily on quantum and reversible metrics, overlooking the critical influence of delay, which makes balanced optimization a significant challenge. This paper presents two reversible BCD adder designs optimized for both delay and quantum cost. One design integrates the decimal carry-skip technique to improve the overall delay. Using reversible logic gates, the proposed architectures efficiently perform BCD addition and implement the required correction logic while maintaining full reversibility. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed designs surpass existing reversible BCD adders, achieving best-case average improvements of 85.12% in delay and 30.75% in quantum cost. These advancements demonstrate the potential of the proposed adders for integration into future quantum-based arithmetic units and scalable reversible computing systems. Moreover, analysis of real banking transaction data underscores the practical importance of BCD addition and its widespread use in accurate and efficient monetary computations."}

By introducing tolerance to fabrication defects into the design of the quantum devices, we can improve the yield of usable quantum chips and lower the cost of useful systems. Automated Compilation Including Dropouts (ACID) is a framework that works in the ancilla-free (or `middle-out') paradigm, to generate syndrome extraction circuits for general stabiliser codes in the presence of defective couplers or qubits. In the ancilla-free paradigm, we do not designate particular qubits as measurement ancillas, instead measuring stabilisers using any of the data qubits in their support. This approach leads to a great deal of flexibility in how syndrome extraction circuits can be implemented. ACID works by constructing and solving an optimisation problem within the ancilla-free paradigm to find a short syndrome extraction circuit. Applied to the surface code, ACID produces syndrome-extraction circuits of depth between $1\\times$ (no overhead) and $1.5\\times$ relative to the depth of defect-free circuits. The LUCI algorithm, the best prior art, yielded a $2 \\times$ overhead, so ACID offers a significant time saving. The yield of surface code chips with a logical error rate at most $10\\times$ the dropout-free baseline is up to $3\\times$ higher using ACID than using LUCI. I demonstrate the broad applicability of ACID by compiling syndrome extraction circuits for bivariate bicycle codes and the colour code. For these circuits, we incur a circuit-depth overhead of between $1\\times$ (no overhead) and $2.5\\times$ relative to defect-free circuits. I believe this work is the first to simulate both of these families of codes in the presence of fabrication defects."}

This approach to QD optimization poses challenges in large solution spaces, where storing many solutions is impractical, and in high-dimensional behavior spaces, where discretization becomes ineffective due to the curse of dimensionality.

We present Gravitational Federated Clustering (GFC), a novel approach to privacy-preserving federated clustering that overcomes the limitations of distance-based methods under varying LDP. Addressing the critical challenge of clustering non-IID data with diverse privacy guarantees, GFC transforms privatized client centroids into a global gravitational potential field where true cluster centers emerge as topologically persistent singularities. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a client-side compactness-aware perturbation mechanism that encodes local cluster geometry as \"mass\" values, and (2) a server-side topological aggregation phase that extracts stable centroids through persistent homology analysis of the potential field's superlevel sets. Theoretically, we establish a closed-form bound between the privacy budget $ε$ and centroid estimation error, proving the potential field's Lipschitz smoothing properties exponentially suppress noise in high-density regions. Empirically, GFC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ten benchmarks, especially under strong LDP constraints ($ε< 1$), while maintaining comparable performance at lower privacy budgets. By reformulating federated clustering as a topological persistence problem in a synthetic physics-inspired space, GFC achieves unprecedented privacy-accuracy trade-offs without iterative communication, providing a new perspective for privacy-preserving distributed learning."}

We ask whether a single, backbone-agnostic layer can condition on \"which city this sequence comes from\", improve accuracy in full- and low-data regimes, and support better cross-city adaptation with minimal code changes.\n  We propose CityCond, a light-weight city-conditioned memory layer that augments existing spatio-temporal backbones. CityCond combines a city-ID encoder with an optional shared memory bank (CityMem). Given a city index and backbone hidden states, it produces city-conditioned features fused through gated residual connections. We attach CityCond to five representative backbones (GRU, TCN, Transformer, GNN, STGCN) and evaluate three regimes: full-data, low-data, and cross-city few-shot transfer on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY. We also run auxiliary experiments on SIND, a drone-based multi-agent trajectory dataset from a signalized intersection in Tianjin (we focus on pedestrian tracks).\n  Across more than fourteen model variants and three random seeds, CityCond yields consistent improvements, with the largest gains for high-capacity backbones such as Transformers and STGCNs. CityMem reduces Transformer error by roughly one third in full-data settings and brings substantial gains in low-data and cross-city transfer.

Termed ``synthetic data'', these generations are often produced before any student finetuning, but some work has considered generating new synthetic samples as training progresses. This paper studies and advocates for the latter case, where data are generated in an iterative, closed-loop fashion that is guided by the current state of the student model. For a fixed budget of generated samples, or a budget in terms of compute spent querying a teacher, we show that this curation of finetuning data affords improved student performance over static generation. Further, while there have been several LLM-specific methods proposed that operate in this regime, we find that simple, inexpensive selection criteria from the active learning literature tend to be most performant. We validate these claims across four mathematical and logical reasoning datasets using four different small language models."}

Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we find that the overlap of low-entropy segments across correct responses strongly correlates with model accuracy, while overlaps involving incorrect responses exhibit stable but unproductive patterns. Motivated by these findings, we propose LESS, a correctness-aware reinforcement framework that performs fine-grained advantage modulation over low-entropy segments. LESS amplifies segments unique to correct responses, suppresses those unique to incorrect ones, and neutralizes segments shared by both, while preserving high-entropy exploration in the underlying RL algorithm.

Under group-invariant Bellman backups for such cases, local symmetry-breaking introduces errors that propagate across the entire state-action space, resulting in global value estimation errors. To address this, we introduce Partially group-Invariant MDP (PI-MDP), which selectively applies group-invariant or standard Bellman backups depending on where symmetry holds. This framework mitigates error propagation from locally broken symmetries while maintaining the benefits of equivariance, thereby enhancing sample efficiency and generalizability. Building on this framework, we present practical RL algorithms -- Partially Equivariant (PE)-DQN for discrete control and PE-SAC for continuous control -- that combine the benefits of equivariance with robustness to symmetry-breaking. Experiments across Grid-World, locomotion, and manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that PE-DQN and PE-SAC significantly outperform baselines, highlighting the importance of selective symmetry exploitation for robust and sample-efficient RL."}

To address these challenges and improve collaborative sensing reliability, we propose a Patch-Based Dual-Branch Channel-Temporal Forecasting Network (D-CTNet). Particularly, with a parallel dual-branch design incorporating linear temporal modeling layer and channel attention mechanism, our method explicitly decouples and jointly learns intra-channel temporal evolution patterns and dynamic multivariate correlations.

Remarkably, they preserve knowledge of once-learned environments sans catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon neuroscientists hypothesize, is due to a singular neural circuitry dynamically overlayed by neuromodulatory agents such as dopamine and acetylcholine. In parallel, deep learning research addresses analogous challenges via domain generalization (DG) and continual learning (CL), yet these methods remain siloed, despite the brains ability to perform them seamlessly. In particular, prior work has not explored architectures involving associative memories (AMs), which are an integral part of biological systems, to jointly address these tasks. We propose Memory-Integrated Reconfigurable Adapters (MIRA), a unified framework that integrates Hopfield-style associative memory modules atop a shared backbone. Associative memory keys are learned post-hoc to index and retrieve an affine combination of stored adapter updates for any given task or domain on a per-sample basis. By varying only the task-specific objectives, we demonstrate that MIRA seamlessly accommodates domain shifts and sequential task exposures under one roof. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks confirm that our AM-augmented architecture significantly enhances adaptability and retention: in DG, MIRA achieves SoTA out-of-distribution accuracy, and in incremental learning settings, it outperforms architectures explicitly designed to handle catastrophic forgetting using generic CL algorithms. By unifying adapter-based modulation with biologically inspired associative memory, MIRA delivers rapid task switching and enduring knowledge retention in a single extensible architecture, charting a path toward more versatile and memory-augmented AI systems."}

A common mitigation approach is to apply some fixed orthogonal transforms, such as Hadamard matrices, before quantization, which typically reduces the dynamic range. Yet, these transforms ignore the statistics of the data, and their optimality is currently not understood. In this work, we derive, for the first time, closed-form optimal linear blockwise transforms for joint weight-activation quantization using standard data-free quantizers for common numerical formats. Specifically, we provide derivations of the optimal adaptive (data-aware) transforms for round-to-nearest (RTN), AbsMax-scaled block quantizers for both integer and floating-point formats. The resulting construction, which we call WUSH, combines a Hadamard backbone with a data-dependent component based on second-order moments, yielding a non-orthogonal transform that is provably optimal under mild assumptions and remains structured for efficient implementation. Preliminary experimental results show that our approach consistently improves upon the Hadamard transform for common formats."}

Designing such reward functions can be challenging and may not generalize well across different tasks. To address this limitation, we leverage the rich world knowledge contained in pretrained video diffusion models to provide goal-driven reward signals for RL agents without ad-hoc design of reward. Our key idea is to exploit off-the-shelf video diffusion models pretrained on large-scale video datasets as informative reward functions in terms of video-level and frame-level goals. For video-level rewards, we first finetune a pretrained video diffusion model on domain-specific datasets and then employ its video encoder to evaluate the alignment between the latent representations of agent's trajectories and the generated goal videos. To enable more fine-grained goal-achievement, we derive a frame-level goal by identifying the most relevant frame from the generated video using CLIP, which serves as the goal state. We then employ a learned forward-backward representation that represents the probability of visiting the goal state from a given state-action pair as frame-level reward, promoting more coherent and goal-driven trajectories. Experiments on various Meta-World tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

In this paper, we show that current open echocardiogram datasets are unable to assuage subgroup validity concerns. We improve sociodemographic reporting for two datasets: TMED-2 and MIMIC-IV-ECHO. Analysis of six open datasets reveals no consideration of gender-diverse patients and insufficient patient counts for many racial and ethnic groups. We further perform an exploratory subgroup analysis of two published aortic stenosis detection models on TMED-2.

Its upper approximation bound for approximating causal and uniformly continuous operators between continuous temporal function spaces and that for approximating uniformly asymptotically incrementally stable second-order dynamical systems are derived. The established proof method of the approximation bound for approximating the causal continuous operators can also be directly applied to state-space models consisting of a linear time-continuous complex recurrent neural network followed by an MLP. Theoretical results reveal that the approximation error of the neural oscillator for approximating the second-order dynamical systems scales polynomially with the reciprocals of the widths of two utilized MLPs, thus mitigating the curse of parametric complexity. The decay rates of two established approximation error bounds are validated through two numerical cases.

Finite-sample bounds are derived using concentration inequalities over operator norms, and the framework identifies a data-dependent hypothesis space with guarantees on risk, error, robustness, and approximation. Within this space we design efficient kernel machines leveraging the space folding property of Kernel Affine Hull Machines. Clients transfer knowledge via a scalar space folding measure, reducing communication and enabling a simple differentially private protocol: summaries are computed from noise-perturbed data matrices in one step, avoiding per-round clipping and privacy accounting. The induced global rule requires only integer minimum and equality-comparison operations per test point, making it compatible with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Across four benchmarks, the gradient-free FL method with fixed encoder embeddings matches or outperforms strong gradient-based fine-tuning, with gains up to 23.7 points. In differentially private experiments, kernel smoothing mitigates accuracy loss in high-privacy regimes. The global rule admits an FHE realization using $Q \\times C$ encrypted minimum and $C$ equality-comparison operations per test point, with operation-level benchmarks showing practical latencies. Overall, the framework provides provable guarantees with low communication, supports private knowledge transfer via scalar summaries, and yields an FHE-compatible prediction rule offering a mathematically grounded alternative to gradient-based federated learning under heterogeneity."}

However, when neural networks are trained on a reinforcement learning task, their ability to continue learning from new experiences declines over time. This decline in learning ability is known as plasticity loss. To restore plasticity, prior work has explored periodically resetting the parameters of the learning network, a strategy that often improves overall performance. However, such resets come at the cost of a temporary drop in performance, which can be dangerous in real-world settings. To overcome this instability, we introduce AltNet, a reset-based approach that restores plasticity without performance degradation by leveraging twin networks. The use of twin networks anchors performance during resets through a mechanism that allows networks to periodically alternate roles: one network learns as it acts in the environment, while the other learns off-policy from the active network's interactions and a replay buffer. At fixed intervals, the active network is reset and the passive network, having learned from prior experiences, becomes the new active network. AltNet restores plasticity, improving sample efficiency and achieving higher performance, while avoiding performance drops that pose risks in safety-critical settings. We demonstrate these advantages in several high-dimensional control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, where AltNet outperforms various relevant baseline methods, as well as state-of-the-art reset-based techniques."}

Existing methods often assume complete look-ahead information over the scheduling horizon. This assumption contrasts with realistic situations where schedulers can only access incomplete look-ahead information. Sticking with existing methods may lead to suboptimal long-term costs and high-level system nervousness. In this work we propose a Bayesian dynamic scheduling method.

During the online execution, when new disturbances become observed, this method updates the posterior distribution and therefore guides the rescheduling strategy. We compare our method with the existing periodic rescheduling strategy (which generates new schedules from scratch at fixed intervals) on four benchmark problems. Computational results show that our method achieves statistically better long-term costs and system nervousness. In the theoretical aspect, we prove that if disturbances are mutually independent, the impact-quantifying variables inherently satisfy the independence assumptions required by Bayesian Networks. As an implication, practitioners can extend the method to other scheduling problems (such as job shop scheduling and continuous processes), given that they define the problem-specific dependencies between operations."}

Preprint, to appear in KDD'26", "summary": "Algorithmic reasoning -- the ability to perform step-by-step logical inference -- has become a core benchmark for evaluating reasoning in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). Ideally, one would like to design a single model capable of performing well on multiple algorithmic reasoning tasks simultaneously. However, this is challenging when the execution steps of algorithms differ from one another, causing negative interference when they are trained together.\n  We propose branching neural networks, a principled architecture for multitask algorithmic reasoning. Searching for the optimal $k$-ary tree with $L$ layers over $n$ algorithmic tasks is combinatorial, requiring exploration of up to $k^{nL}$ possible structures. We develop AutoBRANE, an efficient algorithm that reduces this search to $O(nL)$ time by solving a convex relaxation at each layer to approximate an optimal task partition. The method clusters tasks using gradient-based affinity scores and can be used on top of any base model, including GNNs and LLMs.\n  We validate AutoBRANE on a broad suite of graph-algorithmic and text-based reasoning benchmarks. We show that gradient features estimate true task performance within 5% error across four GNNs and four LLMs (up to 34B parameters). On the CLRS benchmark, it outperforms the strongest single multitask GNN by 3.7% and the best baseline by 1.2%, while reducing runtime by 48% and memory usage by 26%. The learned branching structures reveal an intuitively reasonable hierarchical clustering of related algorithms. On three text-based graph reasoning benchmarks, AutoBRANE improves over the best non-branching multitask baseline by 3.2%. Finally, on a large graph dataset with 21M edges and 500 tasks, AutoBRANE achieves a 28% accuracy gain over existing multitask and branching architectures, along with a 4.5$\\times$ reduction in runtime."}

We introduce both multi-representation and single-representation rejection sampling, enabling robustness to settings with multiple faulty sensors or a single faulty sensor.

ModC consistently improves scaling across controlled graph-search tasks and large-scale reasoning benchmarks, spanning model families and sizes from 0.5B to 7B. On OpenThoughts, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B with ModC achieves a 4x efficiency gain over standard training while also improving the maximum attainable Pass@k.

Whilst most literature in this area focuses on Deep Neural Networks more generally, we specifically consider Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification tasks. Building on the hypothesis, we compare simple magnitude-based pruning, a Frank-Wolfe style pruning scheme, and an FW method with momentum on a CNN trained on MNIST. Our experiments track test accuracy, loss, sparsity, and inference time as we vary the dense pre-training budget from 1 to 10 epochs. We find that FW with momentum yields pruned networks that are both sparser and more accurate than the original dense model and the simple pruning baselines, while incurring minimal inference-time overhead in our implementation. Moreover, FW with momentum reaches these accuracies after only a few epochs of pre-training, indicating that full pre-training of the dense model is not required in this setting."}

In this problem, the goal is to construct a threshold decision tree that partitions data into k clusters while minimizing the k-medians objective. These trees are interpretable because each internal node makes a simple decision by thresholding a single feature, allowing users to trace and understand how each point is assigned to a cluster. We present the first algorithm for explainable k-medians under lp norm for every finite p >= 1. Our algorithm achieves an O(p(log k)^{1 + 1/p - 1/p^2}) approximation to the optimal k-medians cost for any p >= 1. Previously, algorithms were known only for p = 1 and p = 2. For p = 2, our algorithm improves upon the existing bound of O(log^{3/2}k), and for p = 1, it matches the tight bound of log k + O(1) up to a multiplicative O(log log k) factor. We show how to implement our algorithm in a dynamic setting. The dynamic algorithm maintains an explainable clustering under a sequence of insertions and deletions, with amortized update time O(d log^3 k) and O(log k) recourse, making it suitable for large-scale and evolving datasets."}

We introduce two innovations: (1) learnable Riemannian metrics identifying important frequency feature components, (2) variational prototype optimization through energy function minimization. Classification is performed via Voronoi tessellation under the learned Riemannian metric, where each prototype defines a decision region and test samples are assigned to the nearest prototype, providing clear geometric interpretability. This work demonstrates that the integration of fiber bundle with machine learning provides interpretability and efficiency, which are difficult to obtain simultaneously in conventional deep learning."}

Such shifts can take many forms: new classes may emerge that were absent during training, a problem known as open-set recognition, and the distribution of known categories may change. Guarantees on open-set recognition are mostly derived under the assumption that the distribution of known classes, which we call \\emph{the background distribution}, is fixed. In this paper we develop \\ours{}, a method that is guaranteed to solve open-set recognition even in the challenging case where the background distribution shifts. We prove that the method works under benign assumptions that the novel class is separable from the non-novel classes, and provide theoretical guarantees that it outperforms a representative baseline in a simplified overparameterized setting. We develop techniques to make \\ours{} scalable and robust, and perform comprehensive empirical evaluations on image and text data.

Many modern MLIPs rely on a scalar regression formulation; given information about a molecule, they predict a single energy value and corresponding forces while minimizing absolute error with DFT's calculations. In this work, we explore a multi-class classification formulation that predicts a categorical distribution over energy/force values, providing richer supervision through multiple targets. Most importantly, this approach offers a principled way to quantify model uncertainty.\n  In particular, our method predicts a histogram of the energy/force distribution, converts scalar targets into histograms, and trains the model using cross-entropy loss. Our results demonstrate that this categorical formulation can achieve absolute error performance comparable to regression baselines. Furthermore, this representation enables the quantification of epistemic uncertainty through the entropy of the predicted distribution, offering a measure of model confidence absent in scalar regression approaches."}

Traditional methods, such as FEM-based simulations offer high accuracy but computationally prohibitive for early-stage design, often requiring multiple iterative redesign cycles to resolve late-stage thermal failures. To address these challenges, we propose 'ThermAl', a physics-informed generative AI framework which effectively identifies heat sources and estimates full-chip transient and steady-state thermal distributions directly from input activity profiles. ThermAl employs a hybrid U-Net architecture enhanced with positional encoding and a Boltzmann regularizer to maintain physical fidelity. Our model is trained on an extensive dataset of heat dissipation maps, ranging from simple logic gates (e.g., inverters, NAND, XOR) to complex designs, generated via COMSOL. Experimental results demonstrate that ThermAl delivers precise temperature mappings for large circuits, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of only 0.71°C, and outperforms conventional FEM tools by running up to ~200 times faster. We analyze performance across diverse layouts and workloads, and discuss its applicability to large-scale EDA workflows. While thermal reliability assessments often extend beyond 85°C for post-layout signoff, our focus here is on early-stage hotspot detection and thermal pattern learning. To ensure generalization beyond the nominal operating range 25-55°C, we additionally performed cross-validation on an extended dataset spanning 25-95°C maintaining a high accuracy (<2.2% full-scale RMSE) even under elevated temperature conditions representative of peak power and stress scenarios."}

A model-free Q-learning algorithm was implemented to dynamically adjust the brightness of a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) based on real-time feedback from a light-dependent resistor (LDR) sensor. The system was trained to stabilize at 13 distinct light intensity levels (L1 to L13), with each target corresponding to a specific range within the 64-state space derived from LDR readings. A total of 130 trials were conducted, covering all target levels with 10 episodes each. Performance was evaluated in terms of convergence speed, steps taken, and time required to reach target states. Box plots and histograms were generated to analyze the distribution of training time and learning efficiency across targets. Experimental validation demonstrated that the agent could effectively learn to stabilize at varying light levels with minimal overshooting and smooth convergence, even in the presence of environmental perturbations.

Complex physical systems are often characterized through the integration of a limited number of point sensors in combination with scientific computations which approximate the dominant, full-state dynamics. Simulation models, however, inevitably neglect small-scale or hidden processes, are sensitive to perturbations, or oversimplify parameter correlations, leading to reconstructions that often diverge from the reality measured by sensors. This creates a critical need for data assimilation, the process of integrating observational data with predictive simulation models to produce coherent and accurate estimates of the full state of complex physical systems. We propose a machine learning framework for Data Assimilation with a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (DA-SHRED) which bridges the simulation-to-real (SIM2REAL) gap between computational modeling and experimental sensor data. For real-world physics systems modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields, where the full state cannot be directly observed and must be inferred from sparse sensor measurements, we leverage the latent space learned from a reduced simulation model via SHRED, and update these latent variables using real sensor data to accurately reconstruct the full system state. Furthermore, our algorithm incorporates a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics based regression model in the latent space to identify functionals corresponding to missing dynamics in the simulation model. We demonstrate that DA-SHRED successfully closes the SIM2REAL gap and additionally recovers missing dynamics in highly complex systems, demonstrating that the combination of efficient temporal encoding and physics-informed correction enables robust data assimilation."}

We evaluate CEDC on a suite of algorithmic and natural language tasks, including integer addition, sorting, Dyck-2 language recognition, and three text classification benchmarks. Compared to static training and standard curriculum learning baselines, CEDC achieves up to 30x greater length extrapolation, is 3.75x more computationally efficient than uniform data augmentation, and requires no manual difficulty heuristics.

Building on this, we propose LGDC (latent graph diffusion via spectrum-preserving coarsening), a hybrid framework that combines strengths of both approaches. LGDC employs a spectrum-preserving coarsening-decoarsening to bidirectionally map between graphs and a latent space, where diffusion efficiently generates latent graphs before expansion restores detail.

Existing DNNs-based methods typically formulate TFR-HSS as a one-to-one regression problem based solely on target sparse measurements, without effectively leveraging reference simulation data that implicitly encode thermal knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose IPTR, an implicit physics-guided temperature field reconstruction framework that introduces sparse monitoring-temperature field pair from reference simulations as priors to enrich physical understanding. To integrate both reference and target information, we design a dual physics embedding module consisting of two complementary branches: an implicit physics-guided branch employing cross-attention to distill latent physics from the reference data, and an auxiliary encoding branch based on Fourier layers to capture the spatial characteristics of the target observation. The fused representation is then decoded to reconstruct the full temperature field.

NuCLR brings together views of the same neuron observed at different times and across different stimuli and uses a contrastive objective to pull these representations together. To capture population context without assuming any fixed neuron ordering, we build a spatiotemporal transformer that integrates activity in a permutation-equivariant manner. Across multiple electrophysiology and calcium imaging datasets, a linear decoding evaluation on top of NuCLR representations achieves a new state-of-the-art for both cell type and brain region decoding tasks, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen animals. We present the first systematic scaling analysis for neuron-level representation learning, showing that increasing the number of animals used during pretraining consistently improves downstream performance.

We hypothesize that this reliance on diffusive learning creates \"Catastrophic Rigidity\", rendering models unable to adapt to novel concepts without destroying their pre-trained reasoning capabilities. To isolate this phenomenon, we introduce Iterative Semantic Map Refinement (ISMR), a diagnostic protocol revealing that alignment is a fixed geometric barrier that scaling cannot solve; a 20-layer model overcomes this barrier no faster than a 1-layer model. We introduce the Phase-Resonant Intelligent Spectral Model (PRISM). PRISM encodes semantic identity as resonant frequencies in the complex domain (C^d) and replaces quadratic self-attention with linearithmic O(N log N) Gated Harmonic Convolutions. We validate PRISM on the WMT14 translation task. While the Standard Transformer maintains a slight edge in general competence on static benchmarks (23.88 vs 21.40 BLEU), it fails the \"Plasticity-Stability\" stress test completely. When injected with novel concepts, the Transformer suffers Catastrophic Forgetting, degrading by -10.55 BLEU points while achieving only 60% acquisition. In contrast, PRISM demonstrates Lossless Plasticity, achieving 96% 5-shot acquisition with negligible degradation (-0.84 BLEU).

Traditional linear models cannot capture the complex nonlinear characteristics of electricity pricing, necessitating advanced machine learning approaches. This study compares eight machine learning models using Spanish electricity market data, integrating consumption, generation, and meteorological variables. The models evaluated include linear regression, ridge regression, decision tree, KNN, random forest, gradient boosting, SVR, and XGBoost. Results show that KNN achieves the best performance with R^2 of 0.865, MAE of 3.556, and RMSE of 5.240. To enhance interpretability, LIME analysis reveals that meteorological factors and supply-demand indicators significantly influence price fluctuations through nonlinear relationships.

Traditional OPF solving methods typically employ iterative optimization algorithms (such as interior point methods, sequential quadratic programming, etc.), with limitations including low computational efficiency, initial value sensitivity, and low batch computation efficiency. Most existing deep learning-based OPF methods rely on supervised learning, requiring pre-solving large numbers of cases, and have difficulty guaranteeing physical consistency. This paper proposes an Optimal Power Flow solving method based on neural network dynamics and energy gradient flow, transforming OPF problems into energy minimization problems. By constructing an energy function to measure the degree of deviation from the constraint manifold, and guiding networks to learn optimal solutions that simultaneously satisfy power flow constraints and minimize costs through gradient flow.

Nonetheless, recent theoretical insights presented in CAR suggest a potential alignment, raising the important question of how to realize this in practice. This paper first identifies a key gap between theory and practice by comparing standard policy optimization (SPO) and adversarially robust policy optimization (ARPO). Although they share theoretical consistency, a fundamental tension between robustness and optimality arises in practical policy gradient methods. SPO tends toward convergence to vulnerable first-order stationary policies (FOSPs) with strong natural performance, whereas ARPO typically favors more robust FOSPs at the expense of reduced returns. Furthermore, we attribute this tradeoff to the reshaping effect of the strongest adversary in ARPO, which significantly complicates the global landscape by inducing deceptive sticky FOSPs. This improves robustness but makes navigation more challenging. To alleviate this, we develop the BARPO, a bilevel framework unifying SPO and ARPO by modulating adversary strength, thereby facilitating navigability while preserving global optima. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that BARPO consistently outperforms vanilla ARPO, providing a practical approach to reconcile theoretical and empirical performance."}

However, such lengthy generation shifts the inference bottleneck from compute-bound to memory-bound. To generate each token, the model applies full attention to all previously generated tokens, requiring memory access to an increasingly large KV-Cache. Consequently, longer generations demand more memory access for every step, leading to substantial pressure on memory bandwidth.\n  To address this, we introduce SparseSpec, a speculative decoding framework that reuses the same model as the draft and target models (i.e., self-speculation). SparseSpec features a novel sparse attention mechanism, PillarAttn, as the draft model, which accurately selects critical tokens via elegantly reusing information from the verification stage. Furthermore, SparseSpec co-designs self-speculation with three system innovations: (1) a unified scheduler to batch token drafting and verification, (2) delayed verification for CPU/GPU overlap, and (3) dynamic KV-Cache management to maximize memory utilization. Across various models and datasets, SparseSpec outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, with an up to 2.13x throughput speedup."}

Under standard assumptions on the loss function for velocity field estimation and boundedness of the data distribution, we show that a sufficiently expressive neural network can learn a velocity field such that with $\\mathcal{O}(ε^{-4})$ samples, such that the Wasserstein-2 distance between the learned and the true distribution is less than $\\mathcal{O}(ε)$. The key technical idea is to decompose the velocity field estimation error into neural-network approximation error, statistical error due to the finite sample size, and optimization error due to the finite number of optimization steps for estimating the velocity field.

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) addresses this by reducing the precision of model weights, typically to 4-bit or lower. However, uniform quantization often leads to significant performance degradation due to the presence of ``outlier features'' -- weights that, while few in number, are critical for maintaining model accuracy. Current state-of-the-art methods such as AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) and SpQR (Sparse Quantization Representations) rely on calibration data to identify these salient weights via activation magnitudes or Hessian sensitivity. In scenarios where data privacy is paramount or calibration data is unavailable, these methods are inapplicable.\n  In this work, we propose a data-free, structure-aware hypothesis: that the weights identified as Principal Components via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are intrinsically important to the model's downstream performance. We introduce a novel selection heuristic that preserves the top-$k$ weights aligned with the principal components in FP32, while aggressively quantizing the residual weights. We compare our method against activation-aware (AWQ) and second-order (SpQR) methods across GLUE benchmarks (MRPC, RTE, QNLI) using a DistilBERT backbone. Our experiments reveal that structural importance is highly correlated with functional importance. On the challenging RTE task, our SVD-based method achieves an accuracy of 66.06\\%, outperforming both AWQ (65.34\\%) and SpQR (65.34\\%) at high protection budgets, validating that intrinsic matrix structure can serve as a robust proxy for weight saliency without the need for forward passes or calibration data."}

We demonstrated that the directed evolution algorithm is an effective strategy for uncertainty exploration, enhancing generalization in reinforcement learning.

In contrast to previous methods that use PDE loss solely as external optimization targets, PRISMA integrates PDE residuals as integral architectural features, making it inherently fast, robust, accurate, and free from sensitive hyperparameter tuning. We show that PRISMA has competitive accuracy, at substantially lower inference costs, compared to previous methods across five benchmark PDEs, especially with noisy observations, while using 10x to 100x fewer denoising steps, leading to 15x to 250x faster inference."}

This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization. We hope that the shared insights and the developed recipes for stable RL training will facilitate future research."}

This communication gap limits the accessibility and practical impact of scenario-based modeling, particularly as energy transitions grow more complex with rising shares of renewables, sectoral integration, and deep uncertainties. To address this challenge, we propose the Renewable Energy Large Language Model (RE-LLM), a hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the energy system modeling workflow. RE-LLM combines three core elements: (i) optimization-based scenario exploration, (ii) machine learning surrogates that accelerate computationally intensive simulations, and (iii) LLM-powered natural language generation that translates complex results into clear, stakeholder-oriented explanations. This integrated design not only reduces computational burden but also enhances inter-pretability, enabling real-time reasoning about trade-offs, sensitivities, and policy implications. The framework is adaptable across different optimization platforms and energy system models, ensuring broad applicability beyond the case study presented.

We propose Combined backBones (ComBo), a simple and scalable probing-based adapter that effectively integrates features from multiple models and layers. ComBo compresses activations from layers of one or more FMs into compact token-wise representations and processes them with a lightweight transformer for task-specific prediction. Crucially, ComBo does not require dataset-specific tuning or backpropagation through the backbone models. However, not all models are equally relevant for all tasks. To address this, we introduce a mechanism that leverages ComBo's joint multi-backbone probing to efficiently evaluate each backbone's task-relevance, enabling both practical model comparison and improved performance through selective adaptation. On the 19 tasks of the VTAB-1k benchmark, ComBo outperforms previous probing methods, matches or surpasses more expensive alternatives, such as distillation-based model merging, and enables efficient probing of tuned models.

Our theoretical analysis shows that EXCAP provides smooth and stable explanations over time and is robust to perturbations in causal masks. Extensive experiments on classification and forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EXCAP achieves strong predictive accuracy while generating coherent and causally grounded explanations.

The exposition is closely integrated with the NeuralOperator 2.0.0 library, offering modular state-of-the-art implementations that faithfully reflect the theory. By connecting rigorous foundations with practical insight, this guide aims to establish a clear and reliable framework for applying FNOs effectively across diverse scientific and engineering fields."}

Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this, LLMs struggle to make intelligent meta-cognition decisions. Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion. During inference, we maximize this utility with meta-actions that determine which prefix of tokens to continue or initiate sampling from. On mixed-difficulty mathematical benchmarks, ZIP-RC improves accuracy by up to 12% over majority voting at equal or lower average cost, and traces smooth Pareto frontiers between quality, compute, and latency. By providing real-time reward-cost introspection, ZIP-RC enables adaptive, efficient reasoning."}

This paper proposes Decomposition, Thresholding, and Scaling (DTS), an approximation-based personalized merging framework that preserves task-specific information with minimal storage overhead. DTS first applies singular value decomposition to the task-specific information and retains only a small subset of singular values and vectors. It then introduces a novel thresholding strategy that partitions singular vector elements into groups and assigns a scaling factor to each group. To enable generalization to unseen tasks, we further extend DTS with a variant that fuses task-specific information in a data-free manner based on the semantic similarity of task characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while requiring only 1\\% additional storage per task. Furthermore, experiments on unseen tasks show that the DTS variant achieves significantly better generalization performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/krumpguo/DTS."}

Recent work showed that under square loss, flat solutions (motivated by flat / stable minima and Edge of Stability phenomenon) provably cannot overfit, but it remains unclear whether the same phenomenon holds for logistic loss. This is a puzzling open problem because existing work on logistic loss shows that gradient descent with increasing step size converges to interpolating solutions (at infinity, for the margin-separable cases). In this paper, we prove that the \\emph{flatness implied generalization} is more delicate under logistic loss. On the positive side, we show that flat solutions enjoy near-optimal generalization bounds within a region between the left-most and right-most \\emph{uncertain} sets determined by each candidate solution.

Our formulation encompasses existing multi-view diffusion models, while providing new degrees of freedom for view interaction and fusion. We establish theoretical properties under mild assumptions, including ergodicity of both the point-wise operator and the process in itself. We also derive MDT-based diffusion distances, and associated embeddings via singular value decompositions. Finally, we propose various strategies for learning MDT operators within the defined operator space, guided by internal quality measures. Beyond enabling flexible model design, MDTs also offer a neutral baseline for evaluating diffusion-based approaches through comparison with randomly selected MDTs.

Yet many of these models circulate with their internal semantics undocumented or even intentionally withheld. Such opaque classifiers, which may expose only hard-label outputs, can operate in unregulated web environments or be repurposed for unknown intents, raising legitimate forensic and auditing concerns. In this paper, we position ourselves as investigators and work to infer the semantic concept each label encodes in an undocumented black-box classifier.\n  Specifically, we introduce label forensics, a black-box framework that reconstructs a label's semantic meaning. Concretely, we represent a label by a sentence embedding distribution from which any sample reliably reflects the concept the classifier has implicitly learned for that label. We believe this distribution should maintain two key properties: precise, with samples consistently classified into the target label, and general, covering the label's broad semantic space. To realize this, we design a semantic neighborhood sampler and an iterative optimization procedure to select representative seed sentences that jointly maximize label consistency and distributional coverage. The final output, an optimized seed sentence set combined with the sampler, constitutes the empirical distribution representing the label's semantics. Experiments on multiple black-box classifiers achieve an average label consistency of around 92.24 percent, demonstrating that the embedding regions accurately capture each classifier's label semantics. We further validate our framework on an undocumented HuggingFace classifier, enabling fine-grained label interpretation and supporting responsible AI auditing."}

Such problems are representative of practical settings where decision-makers have to deal with uncertainty in the operational environment as well as multiple conflicting objectives due to different stakeholders. We specifically consider travel time uncertainty. We also consider two objectives, total travel time and route makespan, that jointly target operational efficiency and labor regulations on shift length, although different objectives could be incorporated. Learning-based methods offer earnest computational advantages as they can repeatedly solve problems with limited interference from the decision-maker. We specifically focus on end-to-end deep learning models that leverage the attention mechanism and multiple solution trajectories. These models have seen several successful applications in routing problems. However, since travel times are not a direct input to these models due to the large dimensions of the travel time matrix, accounting for uncertainty is a challenge, especially in the presence of multiple objectives. In turn, we propose a model that simultaneously addresses stochasticity and multi-objectivity and provide a refined training mechanism for this model through scenario clustering to reduce training time. Our results show that our model is capable of constructing a Pareto Front of good quality within acceptable run times compared to three baselines."}

Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models \"know\" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This \"virtue signaling gap\" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric. Well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent; only 12.5% of models achieve the ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge."}

A powerful framework for addressing such challenges is hierarchical probabilistic modeling, where uncertainty is represented by intermediate variables and resolved through marginalization during inference. Inspired by this principle, we propose Cascaded Sensing (Cas-Sensing), a hierarchical reconstruction framework that integrates an autoencoder-diffusion cascade. First, a neural operator-based functional autoencoder reconstructs the dominant structures of the original field - including large-scale components and geometric boundaries - from arbitrary sparse inputs, serving as an intermediate variable. Then, a conditional diffusion model, trained with a mask-cascade strategy, generates fine-scale details conditioned on these large-scale structures. To further enhance fidelity, measurement consistency is enforced via the manifold constrained gradient based on Bayesian posterior sampling during the generation process. This cascaded pipeline substantially alleviates ill-posedness, delivering accurate and robust reconstructions. Experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate that Cas-Sensing generalizes well across varying sensor configurations and geometric boundaries, making it a promising tool for practical deployment in scientific and engineering applications."}

In this study, we explore this question by examining temporally-resolved brain signals of participants listening to 10 hours of an audiobook. We study these neural dynamics jointly with a benchmark encompassing 22 LLMs varying in size and architecture type. Our analyses confirm that LLMs and the brain generate representations in a similar order: specifically, activations in the initial layers of LLMs tend to best align with early brain responses, while the deeper layers of LLMs tend to best align with later brain responses. This brain-LLM alignment is consistent across transformers and recurrent architectures. However, its emergence depends on both model size and context length. Overall, this study sheds light on the sequential nature of computations and the factors underlying the partial convergence between biological and artificial neural networks."}

Current systems increasingly operate in rapidly evolving environments that generate diverse yet interconnected data modalities -- such as time series, system logs, and tabular records -- as exemplified by modern IT systems. Effective AD methods in such environments must therefore possess two critical capabilities: (1) the ability to handle heterogeneous data formats within a unified framework, allowing the model to process and detect multiple modalities in a consistent manner during anomalous events; (2) a strong generalization ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios without extensive retraining. However, most existing methods fall short of these requirements, as they typically focus on single modalities and lack the flexibility to generalize across domains. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm: In-Context Anomaly Detection (ICAD), where anomalies are defined by their dissimilarity to a relevant reference set of normal samples. Under this paradigm, we propose ICAD-LLM, a unified AD framework leveraging Large Language Models' in-context learning abilities to process heterogeneous data within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICAD-LLM achieves competitive performance with task-specific AD methods and exhibits strong generalization to previously unseen tasks, which substantially reduces deployment costs and enables rapid adaptation to new environments.

As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. The results show that Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs and 19X on GPUs over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware.

To address this issue, we revisit the well-known federated learning method Scaffold (Karimireddy et al., 2020) under a gradient tracking perspective, and propose a unified spatio-temporal gradient tracking algorithm, termed ST-GT, for distributed stochastic optimization over time-varying graphs. ST-GT tracks the global gradient across neighboring nodes to mitigate data heterogeneity, while maintaining a running average of local gradients to substantially suppress noise, with slightly more storage overhead. Without assuming bounded data heterogeneity, we prove that ST-GT attains a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems and a sublinear rate for nonconvex cases. Notably, ST-GT achieves the first linear speed-up in communication complexity with respect to the number of local updates per round $τ$ for the strongly-convex setting. Compared to traditional gradient tracking methods, ST-GT reduces the topology-dependent noise term from $σ^2$ to $σ^2/τ$, where $σ^2$ denotes the noise level, thereby improving communication efficiency."}

However, even recent data-driven methods of constitutive modeling, such as constitutive artificial neural networks (CANNs), still require substantial expert knowledge and human labor. We present a framework in which an LLM generates a CANN on demand, tailored to a given material class and dataset provided by the user. The framework covers LLM-based architecture selection, integration of physical constraints, and complete code generation. Evaluation on three benchmark problems demonstrates that LLM-generated CANNs achieve accuracy comparable to or greater than manually engineered counterparts, while also exhibiting reliable generalization to unseen loading scenarios and extrapolation to large deformations. These findings indicate that LLM-based generation of physics-constrained neural networks can substantially reduce the expertise required for constitutive modeling and represent a step toward practical end-to-end automation."}

Surprisingly, LLR has been found to improve worst-group accuracy even when the held-out set is an imbalanced subset of the training set. We initially hypothesize that this ``unreasonable effectiveness'' of LLR is explained by its ability to mitigate neural collapse through the held-out set, resulting in the implicit bias of gradient descent benefiting robustness. Our empirical investigation does not support this hypothesis.

To this end, we study what RL post-training teaches about skill composition and how the structure of the composition affects the skill transfer. We focus on the Countdown task (given n numbers and a target, form an expression that evaluates to the target) and analyze model solutions as expression trees, where each subtree corresponds to a reusable subtask and thus can be viewed as a ``skill.'' Tracking tree shapes and their success rates over training, we find: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to larger n and to unseen tree shapes, indicating compositional reuse of subtasks; (ii) a structure-dependent hierarchy of learnability -- models master shallow balanced trees (workload is balanced between subtasks) before deep unbalanced ones, with persistent fragility on right-heavy structures (even when the composition depth is the same as some left-heavy structures).

With RS, achieving high accuracy at small radii requires a small noise variance, while achieving high accuracy at large radii requires a large noise variance. However, the global noise variance used in the standard RS formulation leads to a fundamental limitation: there exists no global noise variance that simultaneously achieves strong performance at both small and large radii. To break through the global variance limitation, we propose a dual RS framework which enables input-dependent noise variances. To achieve that, we first prove that RS remains valid with input-dependent noise variances, provided the variance is locally constant around each input. Building on this result, we introduce two components which form our dual RS framework: (i) a variance estimator first predicts an optimal noise variance for each input, (ii) this estimated variance is then used by a standard RS classifier. The variance estimator is independently smoothed via RS to ensure local constancy, enabling flexible design. We also introduce training strategies to iteratively optimize the two components. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 show that our dual RS method provides strong performance for both small and large radii-unattainable with global noise variance-while incurring only a 60% computational overhead at inference. Moreover, it consistently outperforms prior input-dependent noise approaches across most radii, with particularly large gains at radii 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0, achieving relative improvements of 19%, 24%, and 21%, respectively. On ImageNet, dual RS remains effective across all radii.

Active learning is a well-established framework in machine learning in which the learner selectively queries labels, often achieving substantially higher accuracy and efficiency than classical supervised methods-especially in settings where labeling is costly or time-consuming, such as hiring, admissions, and loan decisions. Strategic classification, however, addresses scenarios where agents modify their features to obtain more favorable outcomes, resulting in observed data that is not truthful. Such manipulation introduces challenges beyond those in learning from clean data. Our goal is to design active and noise-tolerant algorithms that remain effective in strategic environments-algorithms that classify strategic agents accurately while issuing as few label requests as possible. The central difficulty is to simultaneously account for strategic manipulation and preserve the efficiency gains of active learning.\n  Our main result is an algorithm for actively learning linear separators in the strategic setting that preserves the exponential improvement in label complexity over passive learning previously obtained only in the non-strategic case. Specifically, for data drawn uniformly from the unit sphere, we show that a modified version of the Active Perceptron algorithm [DKM05,YZ17] achieves excess error $ε$ using only $\\tilde{O}(d \\ln \\frac{1}ε)$ label queries and incurs at most $\\tilde{O}(d \\ln \\frac{1}ε)$ additional mistakes relative to the optimal classifier, even in the nonrealizable case, when a $\\tildeΩ(ε)$ fraction of inputs have inconsistent labels with the optimal classifier. The algorithm is computationally efficient and, under these distributional assumptions, requires substantially fewer label queries than prior work on strategic Perceptron [ABBN21]."}

This issue arises due to the model's tendency to overwrite previously acquired knowledge with new information.

We formulate a regularization strategy, termed Information Maximization (IM) regularizer, for memory-based continual learning methods, which is based exclusively on the expected label distribution, thus making it class-agnostic. As a consequence, IM regularizer can be directly integrated into various rehearsal-based continual learning methods, reducing forgetting and favoring faster convergence. Our empirical validation shows that, across datasets and regardless of the number of tasks, our proposed regularization strategy consistently improves baseline performance at the expense of a minimal computational overhead. The lightweight nature of IM ensures that it remains a practical and scalable solution, making it applicable to real-world continual learning scenarios where efficiency is paramount. Finally, we demonstrate the data-agnostic nature of our regularizer by applying it to video data, which presents additional challenges due to its temporal structure and higher memory requirements. Despite the significant domain gap, our experiments show that IM regularizer also improves the performance of video continual learning methods."}

We further decompose this diversity into two primary sources: 'Path Diversity', representing the choice of high-level generative strategies, and 'Execution Diversity', the randomness in executing a chosen strategy. To make this decomposition operational, we introduce three zero-shot, inference-time interventions that directly perturb the latent generative process and reveal how models allocate and express diversity. Application of this probe-based framework to representative AR, MIM, and Diffusion systems reveals three distinct strategies: \"Diversity-Prioritized\" (MIM), \"Compression-Prioritized\" (AR), and \"Decoupled\" (Diffusion).

To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Debiasing Framework grounded in causal inference. We construct a causal graph to model the decision-making process and identify gender bias as the direct causal effect of gender on the prediction. During inference, we employ counterfactual inference to estimate and subtract this direct effect, ensuring the model relies primarily on authentic acoustic pathological features. Extensive experiments on the DAIC-WOZ dataset using two advanced acoustic backbones demonstrate that our framework not only significantly reduces gender bias but also improves overall detection performance compared to existing debiasing strategies."}

Current optimization paradigms impose a static compromise on information channel capacity. For instance, magnitude-based methods, such as AdamW, operate on the assumption that gradient norms are high-fidelity curvature signals. While this allows for precision in smooth regimes, it leads to catastrophic noise amplification when applied to rugged, non-convex landscapes. Conversely, sign-based methods (e.g., Lion) perform a radical 1-bit quantization of the gradient, which aims to provide robust regularization at the cost of discarding fine-grained descent information. We propose that optimal convergence requires neither static prior, but rather a dynamic modulation of the update bitrate. We introduce \\textbf{ThermoLion}, a vision-centric framework that utilizes local Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) gating to autonomously transition parameters between a \"low-bit\" exploration phase and a \"high-precision\" exploitation phase. Furthermore, we introduce a Momentum Alignment mechanism that detects constructive interference between historical drift and instantaneous gradients to accelerate convergence during stable trajectories.

Yet even benign parameter updates can have unintended consequences, such as catastrophic forgetting in classical models or alignment drift in foundation models. Existing heuristic approaches (e.g., regularization, parameter isolation) can mitigate these effects but cannot certify that updated models continue to satisfy required performance specifications. We address this problem by introducing a framework for provably safe model updates. Our approach first formalizes the problem as computing the largest locally invariant domain (LID): a connected region in parameter space where all points are certified to satisfy a given specification. While exact maximal LID computation is intractable, we show that relaxing the problem to parameterized abstract domains (orthotopes, zonotopes) yields a tractable primal-dual formulation. This enables efficient certification of updates - independent of the data or algorithm used - by projecting them onto the safe domain. Our formulation further allows computation of multiple approximately optimal LIDs, incorporation of regularization-inspired biases, and use of lookahead data buffers.

While individual optimization techniques like KV cache quantization, chunked prefill, and model weight quantization have shown promise, their joint effects and optimal configurations for edge deployment remain underexplored. We introduce KV Pareto, a systems-level framework that systematically maps the trade-off frontier between total memory consumption and task accuracy across these three complementary optimization techniques. Our framework evaluates multiple LLM architectures (Qwen, Llama, Mistral) with varying KV quantization schemes (int2/4/8, mixed-precision), granularities (per-token, per-tensor, per-block), and 4-bit weight quantization via AWQ. Our framework identifies model-specific Pareto-optimal configurations that achieve 68-78% total memory reduction with minimal (1-3%) accuracy degradation on long-context tasks. We additionally verify the selected frontiers on additional benchmarks of Needle-in-a-Haystack, GSM8k and MMLU as well as extended context lengths of up to 128k to demonstrate the practical need of joint optimization for efficient LLM inference."}

In this setting, decomposition acts as a \"surgical\" intervention, followed by fine-tuning that serves as \"rehab\" to recover accuracy. Inspired by prehabilitation in surgery, we introduce a pre-compression fine-tuning stage, Low-Rank Prehab, that explicitly encourages low-rank structure in weight matrices while preserving task performance. By conditioning the model before SVD, Prehab steers weights toward spectrally compact regions of the parameter space, enabling smoother low-rank approximation and improved recovery. Experiments on large language models (LLMs) and other Transformer-based architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), show that Prehab substantially reduces the immediate accuracy drop after compression and consistently improves post-finetuning performance. Across a wide range of compression ratios, our method outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based techniques such as SVD-LLM, highlighting the importance of preparing models for compression rather than only improving the compression and recovery stages.

However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs."}

However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments."}

While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can decompose hidden activations into more fine-grained, interpretable features, they often struggle to reliably align these features with human-defined concepts, resulting in entangled and distributed feature representations. To address this, we introduce AlignSAE, a method that aligns SAE features with a defined ontology through a \"pre-train, then post-train\" curriculum. After an initial unsupervised training phase, we apply supervised post-training to bind specific concepts to dedicated latent slots while preserving the remaining capacity for general reconstruction. This separation creates an interpretable interface where specific relations can be inspected and controlled without interference from unrelated features. Empirical results demonstrate that AlignSAE enables precise causal interventions, such as reliable \"concept swaps\", by targeting single, semantically aligned slots."}

Building on this progress, we reinterpret Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEntRL) as a diffusion model-based sampling problem. We tackle this problem by minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion policy and the optimal policy distribution using a tractable upper bound. By applying the policy gradient theorem to this objective, we derive a modified surrogate objective for MaxEntRL that incorporates diffusion dynamics in a principled way. This leads to simple diffusion-based variants of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), termed DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO. All of these methods require only minor implementation changes to their base algorithm. We find that on standard continuous control benchmarks, DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO achieve better returns and higher sample efficiency than SAC and PPO."}

The general form of this problem (along with many of its variants) is NP-hard in nature. In our work, we explore how this problem could be solved with an energy-based optimization method suitable for certain machines with non-von Neumann architectures. We used the Dirac-3, a device based on the entropy computing paradigm and made by Quantum Computing Inc., to evaluate our approach. Our formulations consist of (i) a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization model (QUBO, suitable for Ising machines) and a quartic formulation that allows for real-valued and integer variables (suitable for machines like the Dirac-3). Although current devices cannot solve large NMF problems, the results of our preliminary experiments are promising enough to warrant further research. For non-negative real matrices, we observed that a fusion approach of first using Dirac-3 and then feeding its results as the initial factor matrices to Scikit-learn's NMF procedure outperforms Scikit-learn's NMF procedure on its own, with default parameters in terms of the error in the reconstructed matrices. For our experiments on non-negative integer matrices, we compared the Dirac-3 device to Google's CP-SAT solver (inside the Or-Tools package) and found that for serial processing, Dirac-3 outperforms CP-SAT in a majority of the cases. We believe that future work in this area might be able to identify domains and variants of the problem where entropy computing (and other non-von Neumann architectures) could offer a clear advantage."}

We can define the Schur transform as a unitary operation mapping some set of preferred bases of these Krylov subspaces to computational basis states labeling them. We prove that this transformation can be efficiently learned via gradient descent from a set of training data using quantum neural networks, provided that the fragmentation is sufficiently strong such that the summed dimension of the unique Krylov subspaces is polynomial in the system size. To demonstrate this, we analyze the loss landscapes of random quantum neural networks constructed out of Hilbert space fragmented systems. We prove that in this setting, it is possible to eliminate barren plateaus and poor local minima, suggesting efficient trainability when using gradient descent. Furthermore, as the algebra defining the fragmentation is not known a priori and not guaranteed to have sparse algebra elements, to the best of our knowledge there are no existing efficient classical algorithms generally capable of simulating expectation values in these networks. Our setting thus provides a rare example of a physically motivated quantum learning task with no known dequantization."}

An immediate solution to this impasse is the application of dimensionality reduction methods before passing the data to the quantum algorithm. We investigate six conventional feature extraction algorithms and five autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction models to a particle physics data set with 67 features. The reduced representations generated by these models are then used to train a quantum support vector machine for solving a binary classification problem: whether a Higgs boson is produced in proton collisions at the LHC. We show that the autoencoder methods learn a better lower-dimensional representation of the data, with the method we design, the Sinkclass autoencoder, performing 40% better than the baseline. The methods developed here open up the applicability of quantum machine learning to a larger array of data sets. Moreover, we provide a recipe for effective dimensionality reduction in this context."}
