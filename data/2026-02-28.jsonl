As a step towards this goal, we consider the massive Thirring and Gross--Neveu models with arbitrary number of fermion flavors, $N_f$, discretized on a spatial one-dimensional lattice of size $L$ in the Hamiltonian formulation. We compute the gate complexity using the higher-order product formula and using block-encoding/qubitization and quantum singular value transformations in the limit of large $N_f$ and $L$. We also prepare the ground states of both models with excellent fidelity for system sizes up to 20 qubits with $N_f = 1,2,3,4$ using the adaptive-variational quantum imaginary time algorithm. In addition, we also classify the dynamical Lie algebras of these relativistic fermionic models and show that they belong to the same isomorphism class. Our work is a concrete step towards the quantum simulation of real-time dynamics of large $N_f$ fermionic quantum field theories models relevant for chiral symmetry breaking, understanding dimensional transmutation, and exploring the conformal window of field theories on near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computers."}

B", "summary": "In this letter, we develop a unified semiclassical framework for the thermodynamics and quantization of the Reissner--Nordström (RN) black hole (BH) based on the Misner--Sharp--Hernandez (MSH) mass. Treating the quasi-local horizon energies as the relevant thermodynamic variables, we formulate a horizon-by-horizon first law and Smarr relation. Using a reduced phase-space quantization, we obtain a discrete MSH mass spectrum for both horizons, which reproduces the minimal entropy spacing. Quantum transitions between adjacent levels yield Planck-scale corrections to the Hawking temperatures and a universal logarithmic contribution to the entropy, consistent with independent approaches to quantum gravity. We encode these corrections into a quantum-deformed RN geometry via a simple multiplicative factor that preserves the classical horizon positions while reproducing the corrected surface gravities. The associated effective stress tensor behaves as a conserved vacuum-polarization source with characteristic $r^{-4}$ falloff and a small trace, providing a compact representation of semiclassical backreaction. The deformation slightly lowers both horizon temperatures, weakens the inner-horizon instability, and induces tiny shifts in photon-sphere and shadow observables for macroscopic BHs."}

We apply the general method for homogeneous and isotropic FLRW universes, with zero and positive spatial curvature, for any $f(R)$ model. For the flat case we obtain analytic expressions for the transition probabilities for any model if we assume a constant Ricci scalar; this assumption has been considered in previous studies, in the Euclidean approach, from symmetry arguments. On the other hand, we also obtain explicit solutions without this assumption for power-law $f(R)=R^{1+n}$ models. Moreover, in the positive curvature scenario, we obtain that the assumption of a constant Ricci scalar is not consistent, but we are able to find analytical solutions in approximated regimes. In all cases we have found that the general behavior of the probabilities already found for Einstein Gravity is preserved, including the prediction of a non-singular initial state due to quantum corrections, even though the probabilities increase or decrease in a model dependent way."}

Reversibility in the thermodynamic sense is understood as entropy-preserving processes, such as in the idealized Carnot engine, whereas in integrable dynamical systems it is understood as the conservation of the action variables. Between these two idealized limits, however, where the phase space can become mixed, things are much less clear. In this work, we first determine the extent to which reversible processes are even possible in this regime. We then explore how the dissipative losses resulting from rapidly driving these kinds of systems can be fought by approximate counterdiabatic driving. Finally, we argue that much of the phenomenology should be the same for quantum many-body systems with large degeneracy in the presence of integrability breaking perturbations."}

This allows the Hamiltonian topology to act as a knob for controlling Liouvillian topology and corresponding non-equilibrium dynamics, rather than being passively manipulated by system-environment exchanges. In particular, by exactly solving the Liouvillian spectrum in a class of one-dimensional dissipative lattices, we find that the Hamiltonian band topology constrains the Liouvillian spectral winding and determines the Liouvillian skin effect, provided the Hamiltonian and quantum jump operators respect the same chiral symmetry. We further demonstrate that lattice parity controls the associated bulk-boundary correspondence and the coherence properties of the steady state. Our results unveil a symmetry-enforced topological control of spectral and spatial organization in open quantum systems, providing a unified perspective on topology in Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics."}

We establish a universal entropy--extremality relation that provides thermodynamic evidence for the WGC independently of $f_{R_0}$ and $R_0$. Photon sphere analysis from both geodesic and topological perspectives confirms the simultaneous compatibility of the WGC and WCCC, with the Euler--Heisenberg coupling restoring photon spheres in the naked singularity regime. Gravitational lensing in the strong- and weak-deflection limits reveals that the photon sphere radius is independent of the cosmological background while the critical impact parameter nearly doubles in de Sitter.

To this end, we first derive the equations of motion for both fields on the aforementioned background; these equations are then reformulated uniformly into the Teukolsky equation. Since the Teukolsky equation in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes can be mapped into the Heun equation, we are able to solve quasinormal spectra by employing the Heun function method, not only for photon sphere modes but also for de Sitter and near-extremal modes. We analyze the spectra of all three types for both fields and, in particular, ascertain the effects of the global monopole. In the near-extremal regime, we find that the presence of a global monopole, on the one hand, leaves the strong cosmic censorship conjecture unaffected for scalar perturbations, while on the other hand, it enhance the violation of strong cosmic censorship for Dirac perturbations. Furthermore, we identify that the impact of the global monopole on both the spectra and the strong cosmic censorship is achieved by a shift in the modified multipole number. Our work demonstrates that the Heun function method is an efficient and robust approach for exploring the interaction between asymptotically de Sitter black holes and perturbing fields."}

Significant challenges arise in the metrologically relevant case where the effective interaction between the particles is weak and the particle to be cooled exhibits significant initial motional energy. Here we specifically address the most generally applicable case where the laser-cooled ion and the particle of interest are confined to two spatially separate potential wells with equal motional frequency for resonant enhancement of the cooling dynamics. We analyze the latter through numerical simulations and find that anharmonicities of the potential wells can prevent maintaining the resonance condition throughout the cooling process and thus inhibit a significant reduction in motional energy. We propose a cooling scheme that sweeps the trapping frequency of the potential wells. We show that this scheme enables efficient cooling from cryogenic temperatures all the way to the quantum regime of motion. As a specific application scenario, we analyze the sympathetic cooling of (anti-)protons into the quantum regime of motion for quantum-logic-spectroscopy-based tests of CPT invariance at the quantum limit in Penning traps.

However, despite their flexibility and wide applicability, their performance is fundamentally limited by Barren Plateaus (BP), where gradients vanish and optimization becomes intractable. Noise-Induced Barren Plateaus (NIBP) are particularly interesting, as they are predicted to arise due to noise accumulation independent of circuit structure. We experimentally study NIBP on IBM quantum hardware and demonstrate their absence under non-unital amplitude damping characterized by the qubit's $T_1$ coherence times. We use Information Content Landscape Analysis (ICLA) to efficiently estimate gradient norms for circuits ranging from 8 to 102 qubits, with hundreds of parameters and circuit runtimes of hundreds of microseconds. Classical simulations of the 8-qubit case under noiseless, depolarizing, amplitude damping, and dephasing noise models serve as a baseline comparison. We thoroughly analyze the experimental results considering calibration data, shot-noise, and circuit structure. We robustly observe that the gradient magnitude saturates beyond a characteristic circuit runtime, in contrast with the exponential decay expected from NIBP. Using recent theoretical results, we corroborate that under $T_1$-dominated noise NIBP do not occur and extract an effective $T_1^\\text{eff}$ that is significantly shorter than suggested by standard calibration data. Our results experimentally confirm recent predictions on the absence of NIBP under non-unital noise. These findings also indicate that conventional benchmarking metrics based on average values for device characteristics may be insufficient to predict variational algorithm performance, but full distributions need to be considered."}

In standard thermodynamic protocols involving system--bath interactions, the maximum work is given by the free-energy difference between the initial state and the corresponding Gibbs state at the bath temperature. This motivates a natural question: does information also limit work extraction in closed quantum systems that do not involve a heat bath and where work is obtained through unitary operations generated by a time-dependent Hamiltonian? While ergotropy quantifies the maximum work extractable via unitary operations, it assumes complete knowledge of the quantum state, typically requiring full state tomography. In realistic scenarios, however, only partial information is accessible. In this case, the relevant figure of merit is observational ergotropy, which depends explicitly on the measurement used to probe the system. We show that observational ergotropy decreases under classical post-processing of measurement outcomes, implying that fine-grained measurements allow greater work extraction than coarse-grained ones. Moreover, maximizing observational ergotropy over all possible measurements recovers standard ergotropy, which decomposes into incoherent (classical) and coherent (quantum) contributions. Our results demonstrate that coherence in the measurement projectors constitutes the key resource, enabling work extraction beyond the incoherent limit and establishing coherence as the origin of quantum advantage in observational ergotropy extraction."}

We employ a ring structured XY mixer that restricts the quantum evolution to the subspace of valid cut configurations, ensuring that all sampled states correspond to feasible solutions.

In this work, we investigate ESQPTs within the three-level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, where an enlarged Hilbert space and multiple separatrices give rise to rich spectral structures strongly influenced by chaos. To investigate the different dynamical regions, we have calculated Poincaré sections and Peres lattices. In addition, by combining chaos-sensitive measures with standard ESQPT diagnostics, we provide a static analysis of ESQPT signatures in this model and establish a robust framework for future studies of its dynamical behavior. The degree of chaos and the Kullback-Leibler divergence are found to be very effective chaos-sensitive measures, which are complementary to ESQPT diagnostics such as the mean field limit and the participation ratio. Hence we provide a standard framework to work with ESQPTs in chaotic three-level systems."}

Their performance is commonly quantified by three metrics: pair-collection probability, heralding efficiency, and spectral purity. In bulk-crystal SPDC, these metrics are known to be mutually constrained, yet the physical origin of the resulting trade-offs is often obscured. We show that these trade-offs originate from the frequency-dependent population of discrete spatial modes in the SPDC emission. By performing a Laguerre-Gauss mode decomposition at each frequency component, we show how spectral-spatial non-separability impacts collection probability, heralding efficiency, and purity. We apply this framework to two widely used quasi-phase-matching configurations: collinear degenerate type-0 and type-II SPDC in periodically poled bulk crystals, and quantify how different phase-matching functions shape the spectral-spatial mode structure. In particular, for type-II SPDC we compare standard periodically poled and aperiodically poled Gaussian phase matching. We experimentally validate some of our theoretical results using spatial- and spectral-projection measurements. This spectral-spatial mode analysis provides a quantitative and predictive framework for understanding and engineering bulk-crystal photon sources, enabling systematic multi-parameter optimization beyond qualitative design guidelines."}

Here, we introduce quantum confocal microscopy in Fock space that simultaneously resolves both challenges. Drawing a direct analogy between classical wave optics and quantum state evolution in a bosonic mode, we construct a confocal system with two Fock-space lenses. The first lens deterministically focuses a coherent state into a quantum probe with a tightly concentrated photon-number distribution, while the second lens maps the metrological information back to the vacuum state for efficient readout. Using a superconducting circuit QED platform, we prepare focused probe states with mean photon numbers up to ${N} = 500$, achieving a 21.5$\\pm$1.1 dB compression of the photon-number uncertainty relative to a coherent state, with a scalable quantum circuit of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ operational depth. We demonstrate a displacement sensitivity scaling as $N^{-0.416}$, approaching the Heisenberg scaling ($N^{-0.5}$), and achieve a record metrological gain of 19.06$\\pm$0.13 dB beyond the standard quantum limit. This work establishes quantum confocal microscopy as a scalable and practical framework for quantum-enhanced precision measurement, readily extendable to other bosonic platforms and high-dimensional quantum many-body systems."}

A two-sided master equation yields the fidelity and quantum Fisher information (QFI) of environment states, thereby setting fundamental limits for hypothesis testing and parameter estimation under continuous monitoring. For unmonitored noise or inefficient detection, the QFI of the detectable part of the environment may be obtained from a recently derived GME acting on multiple system replicas. Tilted master equations provide the full counting statistics of quantum jumps and diffusive measurements, enabling, e.g., studies of quantum thermodynamics beyond average values. Here we focus on bosonic linear systems, governed by a quadratic Hamiltonian and linear jump operators, whose dynamics preserves Gaussianity. For Gaussian initial states, we recast a generic GME as a compact set of ordinary differential equations for the covariance matrix (a Riccati-type equation), first moments, and normalization. These equations can be integrated efficiently without Hilbert-space truncation, and admit analytical results in simple settings. We also provide specialized forms for fidelity/QFI and full counting statistics. We illustrate the formalism with a continuously monitored optical parametric oscillator, using it to determine sensitivity limits for frequency estimation and to benchmark Hasegawa's thermodynamic uncertainty relations."}

This defines quantum codes that have constant-depth $\\operatorname{CZ}$ and $\\operatorname{CCZ}$ gates constructed via tensor products of classical group algebra codes, including hypergraph and balanced products. We show that determining the conditions relies on solving the perfect matching problem in graph theory. Conditions are fully determined for the 2- and 3-copy-cup gates, for group algebra codes up to weight 4, including for codes with odd check weight. These include the bivariate bicycle codes, which we show do not have the pre-orientation for either type of copy-cup gate. We show that abelian weight 4 group algebra codes satisfying the non-associative 3-copy-cup gate necessarily have a code distance of 2, whereas codes that satisfy conditions for the symmetric 3-copy-cup gate can have higher distances, and in fact also satisfy conditions for the 2-copy-cup gate. Finally we find examples of quantum codes from the product of abelian group algebra codes that have inter-code constant-depth $\\operatorname{CZ}$ and $\\operatorname{CCZ}$ gates."}

We propose a single-shot echo-based protocol for estimating small rotations about an unknown axis that leverages random symmetric probe states prepared via chaotic dynamics. In contrast to previous protocols for this axis-agnostic rotation sensing problem that depend on difficult-to-prepare anticoherent states, the random probe states used in our protocol can be prepared via constant-depth chaotic circuits composed of random one-axis twisting pulses. We demonstrate analytically that our protocol achieves Heisenberg scaling relative to an arbitrary rotation axis that need not be a priori known. We also investigate the effects of collective and single-particle dephasing in our protocol using analytical and numerical tools. While the requirements on dephasing rates to maintain Heisenberg sensitivity are strict, they are achievable in near-term experiments, for instance, for magnetometric rotosensing with high-spin lanthanide atoms such as dysprosium-164."}
