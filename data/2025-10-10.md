### [1] [Inconsistent Affective Reaction: Sentiment of Perception and Opinion in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07359)
*Jingfei Huang,Han Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了感知与意见情感反应分析方法，通过街景图像和社交媒体文本识别北京二环内情感不一致性，发现感知情感趋于均匀分布而意见情感变化更极端，为城市更新提供策略方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台的兴起改变了我们对城市环境的理解，产生了嵌入人类感知和意见中的情感反应细微变化，这挑战了城市研究中现有的多维情感分析方法。

Method: 构建包含140,750张街景图像和984,024条微博文本的数据集，开发反应指数整合目标检测和自然语言处理技术，使用回归分析、图像分割和词频分析基于土地利用分布对情感反应进行分类和可视化。

Result: 感知情感反应趋势图显示正向情感分布更均匀，而意见情感反应趋势图显示更极端的变化。不匹配图显示人类感知与意见情感存在显著差异，情感反应变化与密集建筑和行人存在等要素有显著关系。

Conclusion: 不一致性地图展示了疫情前后的感知和意见情感，为环境管理和城市更新策略制定提供了潜在解释和方向。

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

### [2] [Haystack Engineering: Context Engineering for Heterogeneous and Agentic Long-Context Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07414)
*Mufei Li,Dongqi Fu,Limei Wang,Si Zhang,Hanqing Zeng,Kaan Sancak,Ruizhong Qiu,Haoyu Wang,Xiaoxin He,Xavier Bresson,Yinglong Xia,Chonglin Sun,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HaystackCraft基准测试，通过模拟真实世界中的噪声长上下文场景（包括异构检索器偏差和智能体工作流中的级联错误）来评估长上下文大语言模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的"大海捞针"基准测试过于简化，忽略了真实世界中噪声上下文来源于有偏检索和智能体工作流这一关键因素，需要构建更真实的测试环境。

Method: 基于英文维基百科超链接网络构建HaystackCraft基准，包含多跳问题，评估异构检索策略（稀疏、稠密、混合和图基）对干扰项组成和LLM性能的影响，并扩展到动态智能体操作场景。

Result: 实验表明：1）更强的稠密检索器会引入更具挑战性的干扰项，但图基重排序能同时提高检索效果并减轻有害干扰；2）在智能体测试中，即使是先进模型也会因自生成干扰项而出现级联失败或难以早期停止。

Conclusion: 智能体长上下文推理仍面临持续挑战，HaystackCraft为未来进展提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

### [3] [Lemma Dilemma: On Lemma Generation Without Domain- or Language-Specific Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07434)
*Olia Toporkov,Alan Akbik,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文实证研究了大语言模型（LLMs）在上下文词形还原任务中的表现，与传统监督方法进行比较，发现在多数语言中LLMs无需微调即可达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在多种NLP任务中表现出色，但尚无证据表明其在上下文词形还原任务中的有效性。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 比较了两种方法：(i) 在域外微调的编码器监督方法，(ii) 跨语言方法，与LLMs直接上下文生成词形的方法进行对比。实验涵盖12种不同形态复杂度的语言。

Result: 实验发现，虽然编码器在域外设置中仍具竞争力，但当前LLMs在多数语言中仅需少量示例即可达到最先进结果，无需先验微调。

Conclusion: LLMs在上下文词形还原任务中表现出色，特别是在缺乏目标域或语言监督数据的情况下，能够超越传统监督方法。

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

### [4] [LASER: An LLM-based ASR Scoring and Evaluation Rubric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07437)
*Amruta Parulekar,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LASER评分标准，利用LLM的上下文学习能力评估ASR系统，解决传统WER指标对形态和句法细微差异过度惩罚的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR评估指标如WER倾向于不公平地惩罚不影响句子语义的形态和句法细微差异，需要更智能的评估方法。

Method: 使用Gemini 2.5 Pro等先进LLM的上下文学习能力，通过包含详细示例的提示来学习评分；同时展示如何微调较小LLM来预测惩罚类型。

Result: Hindi LASER评分与人工标注达到94%的高相关性；Hindi示例对其他印度语言如Marathi、Kannada和Malayalam的错误分析也有效；微调Llama 3预测惩罚类型准确率达89%。

Conclusion: LASER评分标准能有效解决WER的局限性，LLM的上下文学习和微调能力为ASR评估提供了更智能和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

### [5] [Meaningful Pose-Based Sign Language Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07453)
*Zifan Jiang,Colin Leong,Amit Moryossef,Anne Göhring,Annette Rios,Oliver Cory,Maksym Ivashechkin,Neha Tarigopula,Biao Zhang,Rico Sennrich,Sarah Ebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于人体骨骼姿态的手语话语评估框架，涵盖关键点距离、嵌入和回译三种评估指标，并通过自动元评估和人工相关性研究展示了不同场景下的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为手语翻译或生成系统提供实用且可复现的开发和评估方法，解决手语话语评估的标准化问题。

Method: 使用关键点距离、嵌入和回译三种评估指标，通过自动元评估（手语级别检索）和人工相关性研究（跨语言文本到姿态翻译）进行验证。

Result: 揭示了不同评估指标在不同场景下的权衡关系，开发了开源姿态评估工具包。

Conclusion: 该研究为手语翻译系统的开发和评估提供了实用的框架和工具，支持可复现的研究。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on meaningfully evaluating sign language
utterances in the form of human skeletal poses. The study covers keypoint
distance-based, embedding-based, and back-translation-based metrics. We show
tradeoffs between different metrics in different scenarios through automatic
meta-evaluation of sign-level retrieval and a human correlation study of
text-to-pose translation across different sign languages. Our findings and the
open-source pose-evaluation toolkit provide a practical and reproducible way of
developing and evaluating sign language translation or generation systems.

### [6] [Populism Meets AI: Advancing Populism Research with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07458)
*Eduardo Ryô Tamaki,Yujin J. Jung,Julia Chatterley,Grant Mitchell,Semir Dzebo,Cristóbal Sandoval,Levente Littvay,Kirk A. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于提示链的LLM方法，用于测量民粹主义的思想内容，该方法通过模拟人类编码员训练过程，在民粹主义分类任务上达到了与专家人类编码员相当的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于文本分析的民粹主义测量方法成本高、耗时长，难以跨语言、跨上下文和大规模语料库扩展，需要开发更高效、可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 采用基于评分标准和锚点的思维链提示方法，利用全球民粹主义数据库(GPD)训练LLM，模拟人类编码员训练过程，测试了多个专有和开源模型。

Result: 这种特定领域的提示策略使LLM在民粹主义分类任务上达到了与专家人类编码员相当的准确率，能够处理民粹主义的细微和上下文敏感特征。

Conclusion: 基于提示链的LLM方法为测量民粹主义思想内容提供了一种有效、可扩展的替代方案，能够复制人类专家的分类能力。

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

### [7] [MAPRO: Recasting Multi-Agent Prompt Optimization as Maximum a Posteriori Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07475)
*Zheyuan Zhang,Lin Ge,Hongjiang Li,Weicheng Zhu,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAPRO是一个用于多智能体系统提示优化的框架，通过最大后验推理和信念传播算法，解决了多智能体提示优化中的搜索空间爆炸和信用分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统虽然能超越单智能体，但由于提示敏感性和系统不稳定性，设计有效的多智能体系统仍然困难。现有的自动提示设计方法主要针对单智能体，多智能体提示优化仍未被充分探索。

Method: MAPRO是一个四阶段框架：将多智能体系统提示优化建模为最大后验推理问题，使用语言引导的max-product信念传播算法求解，采用拓扑感知的精炼机制整合执行反馈和下游责任来选择性更新智能体提示。

Result: 在多个任务的基准测试中，MAPRO实现了最先进的性能，始终优于手动设计的基线和最近的自动化替代方案。

Conclusion: 基于MAP的公式化为构建更可靠和原则性的多智能体系统提供了通用指导原则。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

### [8] [AsyncSpade: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Asynchronous Sparse Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07486)
*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AsyncSpade是一个异步框架，通过预测查询状态和分离KV缓存过滤，在测试时缩放任务中显著减少推理时间，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放通过长思维链提升LLM推理能力，但线性KV缓存增长加剧了内存瓶颈。现有查询感知稀疏解码方法受限于顺序依赖和粗粒度标记选择，在高并发和长思维链场景下效率低下。

Method: 提出AsyncSpade框架，包含：(1)轻量级时间回归模块预测下一标记查询状态；(2)异步解耦框架将KV缓存过滤与自回归解码循环分离，通过异步机制重叠KV选择与推理计算。

Result: 在A100节点上，AsyncSpade完全重叠KV缓存操作与推理流水线，实现理论最优时间每输出标记。相比SoTA基线Quest减少20%以上TPOT，相比全注意力减少至少50%TPOT，同时在各种TTS基准测试中保持或超越准确率。

Conclusion: AsyncSpade是首个在不牺牲模型性能的情况下消除顺序依赖的方法，为高效TTS提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

### [9] [Can Lessons From Human Teams Be Applied to Multi-Agent Systems? The Role of Structure, Diversity, and Interaction Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07488)
*Rasika Muralidharan,Jaewoon Kwak,Jisun An*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索了基于大语言模型的多智能体系统的团队动态，发现扁平化团队表现优于层级化团队，多样性影响复杂，智能体对团队表现过度自信但反思显示协作价值和整合挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类团队科学启发，研究旨在探索多智能体系统中团队结构、多样性和互动动态等核心方面，填补该领域团队动态研究的空白。

Method: 提出多智能体框架，在常识推理和社交推理四个任务上进行评估，包括访谈和任务后反思分析。

Result: 扁平团队表现优于层级团队，多样性影响微妙，智能体对团队表现过度自信，反思显示协作价值但存在整合挑战和对话协调不足。

Conclusion: 多智能体团队动态研究揭示了扁平结构的优势、多样性的复杂影响以及智能体协作中的整合挑战，为优化多智能体系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

### [10] [Can Speech LLMs Think while Listening?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07497)
*Yi-Jen Shih,Desh Raj,Chunyang Wu,Wei Zhou,SK Bong,Yashesh Gaur,Jay Mahadeokar,Ozlem Kalinli,Mike Seltzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了思维链微调对多流语音大语言模型的影响，提出通过提前推理和基于熵的指标来优化语音交互的准确性和延迟，并使用DPO进一步改进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音大语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现不佳，而思维链方法在文本模型中已证明有效。同时，语音交互的延迟是影响用户体验的关键因素。

Method: 采用思维链微调方法，引入基于熵的'问题完整性'指标来指导模型在用户查询结束前开始推理，并使用直接偏好优化来平衡准确性和延迟。

Result: 思维链微调使语音LLM在口语推理任务上的准确性平均提高2.4倍；提前推理方法在相同延迟条件下在ARC-Easy上获得4%的准确性提升；DPO实现了70%的延迟降低且不损失准确性。

Conclusion: 思维链微调能显著提升语音LLM的推理能力，结合提前推理和DPO优化可以有效地平衡准确性和延迟，改善语音交互体验。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

### [11] [When Thoughts Meet Facts: Reusable Reasoning for Long-Context LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07499)
*Soyeong Jeong,Taehee Jung,Sung Ju Hwang,Joo-Kyung Kim,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL)框架，通过可重用的思维模板来增强长上下文语言模型的多跳推理能力，解决了单纯增加文档数量无法有效连接证据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长上下文语言模型虽然能处理大量文档，但仅将更多文档输入上下文窗口无法有效捕捉证据之间的连接方式，限制了知识密集型多跳推理的效果。

Method: 使用思维模板将推理过程重构为可重用的思维缓存，这些模板源自先前的解题轨迹，能够结构化证据组合方式并指导多跳推理。通过基于自然语言反馈的迭代更新策略来保持模板的有效性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和不同LCLM模型家族中，该方法相比强基线模型在基于检索和无检索设置下均取得了一致的性能提升。优化后的模板还能蒸馏到较小的开源模型中。

Conclusion: ToTAL框架通过思维模板增强了长上下文语言模型的多跳推理能力，展示了广泛的适用性和透明的推理重用机制。

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

### [12] [ParsTranslit: Truly Versatile Tajik-Farsi Transliteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07520)
*Rayyan Merchant,Kevin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新的波斯语-塔吉克语双向音译模型，通过整合所有可用数据集并创建两个新数据集，实现了跨领域的先进音译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语使用两种书写标准（波斯-阿拉伯文和塔吉克-西里尔文），虽然方言相似但文字差异阻碍了塔吉克斯坦与其他波斯语国家的书面交流。现有音译模型受限于特定领域数据集，缺乏实际应用的通用性。

Method: 开发了基于序列到序列的最先进音译模型，整合了所有可用数据集并创建了两个新数据集进行跨领域训练。

Result: 模型在Farsi到Tajik方向获得chrF++ 87.91和标准化CER 0.05，Tajik到Farsi方向获得chrF++ 92.28和标准化CER 0.04，建立了全面的基准性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了更清晰的任务理解，设定了可比较的领先基准，模型、数据和代码均已公开，为波斯语跨文字交流提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ParsTranslit-FB30/.

### [13] [OWL: Overcoming Window Length-Dependence in Speculative Decoding for Long-Context Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07535)
*Jaeseong Lee,seung-won hwang,Aurick Qiao,Gabriele Oliaro,Ye Wang,Samyam Rajbhandari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OWL的新模型，通过LSTM-based drafter、特殊token [SPEC]和混合解码算法，在长上下文场景下显著提升了推测解码的性能，比EAGLE3快约5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法在短上下文（如2K tokens）基准测试中表现良好，但在实际长上下文工作负载中性能严重下降，甚至出现减速现象。

Method: 1) 仅基于最后token状态的LSTM-based drafter；2) 验证器中使用特殊token [SPEC]产生更丰富的表示；3) 结合树和非树解码的混合算法。

Result: OWL在长上下文输入上比EAGLE3实现了约5倍更高的接受长度，解决了现有方法在长上下文场景下的性能退化问题。

Conclusion: 通过LongSpecBench基准测试和OWL模型，为长上下文场景下的推测解码提供了有效解决方案，并发布了所有代码和数据集以推动未来研究。

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了两种方法提升小参数视觉语言模型在图表理解任务中的评估能力：多标准提示和领域自适应迁移学习，创建了ChartJudge模型，在资源受限环境下实现高效评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小参数模型（≤2B）在图表理解任务中作为自动评估者表现不佳，限制了在资源受限环境中的实际应用。

Method: 采用多标准提示（将多个评估标准合并到单个查询中）和领域自适应迁移学习（在图表数据集上使用合成判断微调2B参数模型）。

Result: 多标准提示暴露了7B模型的鲁棒性差距，ChartJudge模型能够有效在不同数据集间迁移知识，成为更专业的模型。

Conclusion: 通过模型大小、提示设计和可迁移性之间的权衡分析，为图表推理任务提供了可扩展、低成本的评估解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 在移动平台上部署NLP模型需要既能适应多样化应用，又能在内存和计算上保持高效的模型。研究预微调策略以增强轻量级BERT编码器对命名实体识别和文本分类任务的适应性

Method: 提出基于任务专用LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，使用单一共享编码器骨干网络和模块化适配器，避免多任务预微调中的优化信号冲突

Result: 在21个下游任务上的实验显示，命名实体识别平均提升0.8%，文本分类平均提升8.8%，性能与单独预微调相当且满足实际部署约束

Conclusion: 该方法为多功能移动NLP应用提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，通过模块化适配器实现了性能与效率的平衡

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过计算语言学分析发现，COVID-19健康错误信息在可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言使用上与真实信息存在显著差异，错误信息可读性更低且包含更多恐惧相关词汇。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过语言分析区分健康错误信息与事实性沟通，为数字健康错误信息检测和公共卫生信息策略提供支持。

Method: 使用三个语料库（COVID-19错误叙事、一般COVID-19内容和猴痘相关帖子）进行可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言的计算语言学分析。

Result: COVID-19错误信息的可读性得分明显更低，恐惧相关或说服性词汇频率是其他数据集的两倍以上，感叹号使用极少，与猴痘内容的情绪化风格形成对比。

Conclusion: 错误信息采用故意复杂的修辞风格嵌入情感线索，这种组合可能增强其感知可信度。研究为健康错误信息检测提供了语言指标，但存在使用传统可读性指数等局限性。

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

TL;DR: 使用LLMs辅助构建人工语言(Constructed Languages)的系统，通过模块化流程创建音系、生成语料、构建词典、设计文字系统，并编写语法手册


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双重目标：一是为构建人工语言提供有趣工具，二是探索LLMs对语言和语言学概念的理解程度

Method: 模块化方法：1) 代理方式创建目标音系 2) 将英语句子翻译为反映目标语言词序和形态句法特征的标记 3) 从翻译语料构建词典 4) 设计文字系统 5) 编写语法手册

Result: 不同LLMs和不同语言规范之间存在能力差异，处理常见模式比罕见模式更容易；在从高资源语言翻译到低资源语言的应用中，目前结果多为负面，但改进版本可能有实际收益

Conclusion: LLMs在构建人工语言方面具有潜力，但能力存在局限性，特别是在处理罕见语言模式时；系统展示了LLMs对语言学概念的理解程度

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了语言模型输入词汇表征的结构及其在训练过程中的演化，发现词汇嵌入几何快速收敛到与语义和句法特征高度相关，高频词和功能词比低频词收敛更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型输入词汇表征的结构如何形成，以及这种结构在训练过程中如何随时间演化，特别关注语义、句法和词频对嵌入几何的影响。

Method: 使用表征相似性分析，对Pythia 12B和OLMo 7B两个开源模型进行实验，将输入和输出嵌入的几何结构与语义、句法和基于频率的指标在训练过程中进行相关性分析。

Result: 1) 词汇嵌入几何在训练早期就快速收敛到与语义和句法特征高度相关；2) 高频词和功能词比词汇词和低频词更快收敛到最终向量，后者仍保留随机初始化偏差的某些对齐。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了词汇几何围绕语言结构组织的动态轨迹，显示了词频和功能词的不同作用，为研究词汇几何演化如何促进模型特定能力增益提供了动机。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在临床编码任务中表现不佳，基于精确匹配的评估方法忽略了层次结构相近的错误预测，这些错误占据了LLM失败的大部分。

Method: 采用轻量级干预（提示工程和小规模微调），引入临床编码验证作为独立任务和流水线组件，并创建了专家双重标注的门诊临床笔记ICD-10编码基准数据集。

Result: 验证被证明是提高基于LLM的医疗编码的有效且可靠的步骤，轻量级干预在不增加计算开销的情况下提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 临床编码验证是改进LLM医疗编码性能的关键方法，解决了层次结构近失误差问题，并通过新数据集缓解了现有数据集的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 访问控制是安全计算的基础，但大型语言模型常常通过产生无限制响应来模糊角色边界，需要研究LLM遵守访问控制策略的能力。

Method: 创建了扩展Spider和BIRD文本到SQL数据集的新数据集，添加了表级和列级的PostgreSQL角色策略，比较了三种设计：零/少样本提示、两步生成器-验证器管道、LoRA微调模型。

Result: 跨多个模型系列，显式验证（两步框架）提高了拒绝精度并降低了错误许可率，同时微调在安全性和实用性之间实现了更好的平衡。更长更复杂的策略持续降低所有系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: 两步验证框架在拒绝精度方面表现最佳，而微调在安全性和实用性之间提供了更好的平衡，复杂策略会降低系统可靠性。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

Motivation: 传统的银行界面采用僵化的多屏幕工作流程，而现有的AI助手仅限于咨询或支持角色。Ryt AI旨在通过自然语言界面完全替代传统银行界面，让客户能够可靠地执行核心金融操作。

Method: 使用内部开发的闭源LLM ILMU，通过四个LLM驱动的代理（护栏、意图、支付和FAQ）来协调单一对话。每个代理使用任务特定的LoRA适配器，部署在银行基础设施内以确保行为一致性。采用确定性护栏、人工确认和无状态审计架构提供深度防御。

Result: 成功实现了首个全球监管批准的自然语言银行界面部署，证明在严格治理下，自然语言界面能够可靠支持核心金融操作。

Conclusion: Ryt AI展示了监管批准的自然语言界面可以可靠地支持核心金融操作，代表了银行服务的正确发展方向。

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

TL;DR: OBCache是一个基于结构化剪枝理论的KV缓存淘汰框架，通过量化token对注意力输出的影响来优化缓存管理，相比基于启发式注意力权重的现有方法能提升长上下文准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓存淘汰方法使用启发式的注意力权重累计来评估token重要性，但没有考虑token对注意力输出的真实影响，导致内存效率不足。

Method: 将缓存淘汰建模为分层结构化剪枝问题，基于Optimal Brain Damage理论推导闭式解来量化token重要性，考虑键、值和键值对三种情况的扰动影响。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上的实验表明，用OBCache的输出感知分数替换现有方法的启发式分数，能持续提升长上下文任务的准确性。

Conclusion: OBCache提供了一个理论严谨的缓存淘汰框架，通过输出感知的重要性评估显著改进了长上下文LLM的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种语言模型社会偏见评估方法：基于token概率(TP)和自然语言推理(NLI)，发现两者行为差异显著，建议结合多种方法进行全面评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于token概率的社会偏见评估方法虽然应用广泛，但被认为与现实语言模型使用场景和危害存在距离，需要探索更现实的替代方案。

Method: 使用自然语言推理(NLI)作为偏见评估指标，并与token概率(TP)方法进行比较分析，测试不同NLI指标之间以及NLI与TP指标之间的相关性。

Result: NLI和TP偏见评估行为差异显著，相关性很低；NLI方法更可能检测到"去偏不足"的情况，但对反刻板印象句子的措辞更加敏感和脆弱。

Conclusion: token概率和自然语言推理都不是在所有情况下"更好"的偏见指标，建议结合TP、NLI和下游偏见评估来确保对语言模型的全面评估。

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token
probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized
for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this
work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative
bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave
substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI
metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more
likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more
brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP
approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language
inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a
combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive
evaluation of language models.

<details>

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的行为规范和伦理原则存在内部冲突和覆盖不足的问题，需要系统化方法来识别和解决这些规范缺陷。

Method: 使用全面的分类法生成多样化的价值权衡场景，迫使模型在无法同时满足的合法原则对之间做出选择。通过价值分类分数评估12个前沿LLM的响应，测量行为分歧。

Result: 识别了超过70,000个显著行为分歧案例，证明模型行为的高度分歧能有效预测模型规范中的潜在问题。发现了直接矛盾、解释模糊性、明显错位案例和误报拒绝等问题。

Conclusion: 模型规范存在系统性缺陷，需要更严格的验证方法。生成的数据集揭示了前沿模型的价值优先模式差异和规范问题，为改进模型规范提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

Motivation: 大型语言模型正在改变细胞生物学，使得开发能够表示、预测和推理细胞状态与行为的计算系统——"虚拟细胞"成为可能。本文旨在系统梳理LLMs在虚拟细胞建模中的应用现状。

Method: 提出统一分类法，将现有方法组织为两个范式：LLMs作为预言机用于直接细胞建模，LLMs作为智能体用于协调复杂科学任务。识别三个核心任务并分析相关模型、数据集和评估基准。

Result: 建立了系统的分类框架，明确了LLMs在虚拟细胞建模中的两种应用模式，并详细梳理了细胞表示、扰动预测和基因调控推断三个关键领域的研究现状。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming cellular biology by enabling
the development of "virtual cells"--computational systems that represent,
predict, and reason about cellular states and behaviors. This work provides a
comprehensive review of LLMs for virtual cell modeling. We propose a unified
taxonomy that organizes existing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles,
for direct cellular modeling, and LLMs as Agents, for orchestrating complex
scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation,
perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their
associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical
challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出CADET因果表示学习框架，通过解构仇恨言论为可解释的潜在因素并控制混杂变量，从表面语言线索中分离真正的仇恨意图，提高仇恨言论检测的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测模型主要依赖表面语言线索，难以有效泛化到不同风格变化。隐性仇恨言论通过讽刺、反讽、刻板印象或编码语言传达，更难检测。不同平台的仇恨言论针对不同群体并采用独特风格，可能引发虚假相关性。

Method: 将仇恨言论生成建模为涉及上下文环境、创作者动机、目标和风格等关键因素的因果图。提出CADET因果表示学习框架，解构仇恨言论为可解释的潜在因素，控制混杂变量，并通过在潜在空间中对风格进行干预实现反事实推理。

Result: CADET在综合实验中表现出优越性能，突显了因果先验在推进可泛化仇恨言论检测方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 因果表示学习框架CADET能够有效分离仇恨意图与表面语言线索，提高仇恨言论检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户与互联网的交互形式正从隐式反馈转向显式文本反馈，这为深度个性化提供了机会。但现有方法将用户历史视为扁平文本列表，无法建模反映用户兴趣动态特性的丰富时间和语义结构。

Method: 提出MemWeaver框架，构建包含行为记忆和认知记忆的双组件层次化记忆。行为记忆捕获具体用户行为，认知记忆表示长期偏好，两者都整合时间和语义信息但处于不同抽象层次。

Result: 在Language Model Personalization (LaMP)基准测试上验证了MemWeaver的有效性。

Conclusion: MemWeaver通过层次化记忆结构成功捕获了用户兴趣的时间演化和语义关系，为LLMs提供了统一的用户表示，实现了深度个性化生成。

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors
and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)
benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SubQRAG是一个基于子问题的图检索增强生成框架，通过将复杂问题分解为可验证的子问题链，动态扩展知识图谱，并构建图记忆来增强多跳问答的推理深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图RAG方法在构建知识图谱连接文档事实时，缺乏深度结构化推理能力，导致复杂多跳问答中证据不完整和错误累积。

Method: 将复杂问题分解为有序的子问题链，为每个子问题从图中检索相关三元组，必要时从源文档实时提取新三元组动态扩展图谱，并将所有推理过程的三元组聚合为图记忆。

Result: 在三个多跳问答基准测试中，SubQRAG实现了持续且显著的改进，特别是在精确匹配分数方面。

Conclusion: SubQRAG通过子问题驱动的框架有效增强了推理深度，解决了传统图RAG在多跳问答中的局限性。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Motivation: 现有MKGC研究未能充分利用LLMs的多语言能力，忽视了跨语言知识的可共享性，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出KL-GMoE（知识级分组混合专家）来高效建模共享知识，以及IER（迭代实体重排）来增强知识利用效率。

Result: 在5语言数据集上，相比现有SOTA方法，Hits@1、Hits@3和Hits@10分别提升了5.47%、3.27%和1.01%。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on

Motivation: GRPO训练LLM时面临模型响应不准确、训练崩溃和性能受限的挑战，特别是在小规模架构中表现更差。

Method: 1) 动态多轮硬采样：用高质量少样本演示替换困难样本，结合指数学习率衰减；2) 自示例思考：去除KL散度，调整裁剪系数，通过额外奖励激励模型自主生成分析示例。

Result: ToolExpander显著提升了LLM的工具使用能力，特别是在较弱的小规模模型中，改善了训练稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: ToolExpander框架有效解决了GRPO在小规模LLM训练中的稳定性问题，提升了模型性能和工具使用能力。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

TL;DR: OpenRubrics是一个大规模(prompt, rubric)对数据集，通过对比式准则生成方法创建多维度的评估准则，用于训练基于准则的奖励模型，在多个基准测试中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励模型主要依赖标量或成对判断，无法捕捉人类偏好的多维度特性。虽然已有研究探索使用结构化自然语言准则，但生成可靠且可扩展的准则仍然是一个关键挑战。

Method: 提出对比式准则生成(CRG)，通过对比偏好和拒绝响应来推导硬规则和原则；使用拒绝采样来确保偏好标签一致性，移除噪声准则；构建OpenRubrics数据集训练准则生成和基于准则的奖励模型。

Conclusion: 准则提供了可扩展的对齐信号，缩小了昂贵的人工评估与自动化奖励建模之间的差距，为LLM对齐开启了新的原则驱动范式。

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

Method: 提出两种不确定性启发的随机采样策略：蒙特卡洛Dropout和加性高斯噪声；设计潜在奖励模型，通过逐步对比目标训练来评分和引导潜在推理。

Result: 实验表明两种采样策略都能有效扩展计算能力并展现不同的探索动态，潜在奖励模型能够有效进行轨迹选择。

Conclusion: 这项工作为连续空间中的可扩展推理开辟了新方向，证明了潜在推理模型同样可以从并行测试时扩展中受益。

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在多项选择题中的推理策略，特别是当LLMs在没有问题的情况下仅根据选项就能成功回答时，这种部分输入的成功是否总是有问题的。

Method: 让推理型LLMs在完整输入和仅选项输入的情况下解决多项选择题，分析推理轨迹以评估策略的深度和忠实性。

Result: 测试时推理通常能提高完整输入和仅选项输入情况下的准确性；仅选项的成功几乎不受推理轨迹长度的影响，且推理轨迹通过了忠实性测试，表明其使用了较少问题的策略，如推断缺失的问题。

Conclusion: 部分输入的成功并不总是有问题的，推理轨迹可以帮助区分有问题的数据和较少问题的推理策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

TL;DR: 论文指出基于结果的奖励在数学推理中容易导致奖励欺骗，模型可能通过错误推理得到正确答案。作者提出了过程导向的Rubric奖励模型来评估整个推理轨迹，显著提升了模型性能和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于结果的奖励机制在数学推理中存在严重缺陷，导致模型通过错误推理过程获得正确答案（假阳性），高估了模型的实际推理能力。需要更可靠的评估方法来确保推理过程的正确性。

Method: 提出了Rubric奖励模型(RRM)，这是一种过程导向的奖励函数，基于问题特定的评分标准评估整个推理轨迹，提供细粒度的校准奖励(0-1)，明确惩罚逻辑缺陷并鼓励严谨推导。

Result: 在四个数学基准测试中，RRM训练一致优于仅基于结果的监督。在AIME2024上将Verified Pass@1024从26.7%提升到62.6%，奇迹步骤发生率减少了71%。

Conclusion: 奖励解决方案过程对于构建不仅更准确而且更可靠的模型至关重要。过程导向的奖励能够显著减少假阳性，提高模型推理的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

Conclusion: 提出了一种有效方法来解决LLMs中真实性与安全对齐之间的冲突，通过特征解耦和子空间正交化技术实现了两者的平衡。

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in
recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving
truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing
truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we
investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often
comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this
arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode
hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress
factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign
datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same
reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related
features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves
refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This
approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety
alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful
benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach
preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between
truthfulness and safety.

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

Motivation: LLMs在单轮任务中表现出色，但在实际多轮交互中会出现上下文漂移问题，即模型输出逐渐偏离目标一致行为，现有静态评估指标无法很好捕捉这种时间演化问题。

Method: 将漂移形式化为测试模型与目标一致参考模型之间逐轮KL散度，提出一个递归模型将漂移演化解释为具有恢复力和可控干预的有界随机过程，在合成重写任务和用户-代理模拟中实例化该框架。

Result: 实验显示漂移表现为稳定的噪声限制平衡而非失控退化，简单的提醒干预能可靠地减少发散，与理论预测一致。

Conclusion: 多轮漂移可被理解为可控的平衡现象而非不可避免的衰减，为研究和缓解扩展交互中的上下文漂移提供了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

Motivation: 大语言模型在大量数据上训练积累了丰富的语义知识，但剪枝通常只用少量校准数据，导致输出不匹配不可避免。直接最小二乘拟合容易过拟合校准集，破坏预训练权重。

Method: 在旋转约束下更新剪枝参数，保持输出表示的几何特性（范数和内积），同时重新对齐剪枝子空间与原始输出。结合方差感知重要性评分，优先保留对主方向影响大的维度。

Result: 在LLaMA-7B模型上实验，在WikiText-2和多个语言理解基准测试中，相比现有基线方法持续获得更好的困惑度和任务准确率。

Conclusion: 旋转约束补偿方法能有效补偿剪枝误差，同时以几何保持的方式保留可能更重要的组件，在多个评估指标上优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to
transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning,

remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation
standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and
agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC,
multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five
families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and
agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation,
trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on
over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and
ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain
dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness,
privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation
domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven
single-cell intelligence and outlines open challenges in interpretability,

TL;DR: HiPRAG是一种用于优化代理式RAG搜索行为的训练方法，通过分层过程奖励来减少过度搜索和搜索不足的问题，提高搜索效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理式RAG存在过度搜索和搜索不足的问题，传统基于结果的强化学习方法缺乏细粒度控制，无法有效解决这些搜索效率问题。

Method: 提出分层过程奖励方法，将代理的推理轨迹分解为离散步骤，实时评估每个搜索决策的必要性，在结果奖励基础上增加基于最优搜索和非搜索步骤比例的额外奖励。

Result: 在7个QA基准测试中，Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型平均准确率达到65.4%(3B)和67.2%(7B)，过度搜索率降至2.3%，同时降低了搜索不足率。

Conclusion: HiPRAG证明了通过强化学习进行细粒度控制对于优化搜索代理推理效率和最优性的重要性和潜力，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

TL;DR: 提出GTD框架，通过条件离散图扩散模型迭代生成多智能体系统的通信拓扑，实现任务自适应、稀疏且高效的拓扑设计。


<details>

Motivation: 多智能体系统的效率高度依赖通信拓扑，但设计最优拓扑面临性能、通信成本和鲁棒性之间的平衡挑战。现有静态拓扑无法适应多样化任务需求。

Method: GTD框架将拓扑合成建模为迭代构建过程，每一步由轻量级代理模型引导，预测多目标奖励（准确率、效用、成本），实现实时、无梯度的任务自适应拓扑优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证，GTD能生成高度任务自适应、稀疏且高效的通信拓扑，在LLM智能体协作中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GTD框架通过迭代引导的拓扑合成过程，有效解决了多智能体系统通信拓扑设计的复杂权衡问题，为LLM驱动的多智能体系统提供了更优的通信结构。

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

Motivation: 生成式信息检索在单语场景表现优异，但在多语言检索中面临跨语言标识符错位和标识符膨胀两大挑战，限制了其应用效果。

Method: 提出MGR-CSC框架，将语义等价的多语言关键词统一为共享原子以对齐语义，压缩标识符空间，并采用动态多步约束解码策略进行检索。

Result: 在mMarco100k和mNQ320k数据集上分别提升检索准确率6.83%和4.77%，同时文档标识符长度分别减少74.51%和78.2%。

Conclusion: MGR-CSC通过跨语言语义压缩有效解决了多语言生成检索中的关键问题，在提升检索准确性的同时显著提高了解码效率。

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To
address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via
Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies
semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align
semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic
multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves
cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on
mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by
74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

TL;DR: AdaSwitch是一种新颖的知识蒸馏方法，通过在token级别动态结合on-policy和off-policy生成，解决小语言模型蒸馏中的训练-推理不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在延迟和计算约束应用中很重要，但现有知识蒸馏方法存在权衡：off-policy蒸馏提供高质量监督但引入训练-推理不匹配，on-policy方法保持一致性但依赖低质量学生输出。

Method: 提出AdaSwitch方法，在token级别动态结合on-policy和off-policy生成。让学生先探索自身预测，然后基于实时质量评估选择性整合教师指导。

Result: 在三个数据集和两个师生LLM对上的实验表明，AdaSwitch持续提高准确性，为蒸馏小语言模型提供实用有效的方法，且额外开销可接受。

Conclusion: AdaSwitch同时保持了一致性和监督质量，为小语言模型的知识蒸馏提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Conclusion: Translation Tangles为解决LLM翻译中的质量和公平性问题提供了系统性的评估工具和基准数据集。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and
dataset are accessible on GitHub:

TL;DR: 该论文研究了长思维链模型中的"过度思考"问题，提出了TRACE分析框架来系统分析思维过程，发现过度验证和过度探索是主要成因，并提出了基于效用的过度思考定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长思维链推理模型在复杂任务上表现出色，但存在过度思考的严重效率问题——即使处理简单查询也会进行不必要的冗长推理，造成计算浪费而准确性没有提升。现有研究对过度思考的成因理解不足，大多停留在表面分析。

Method: 提出TRACE分析框架：1) 将思维过程分解为最小完整子思维；2) 通过推断子思维间的语篇关系构建细粒度思维进展图；3) 识别相似主题查询的常见思维模式。

Result: 基准测试证实长思维模型在简单任务上比短思维模型慢5-20倍且无实质增益。分析发现开放权重思维模型主要有两种模式：探索者模式和晚期着陆模式，表明过度验证和过度探索是过度思考的主要驱动因素。

Conclusion: 基于思维结构提出了基于效用的过度思考定义，超越了传统的基于长度的度量方法，为理解LLM思维进展和系统管理过度思考提供了更深入的理论指导和实践指南。

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark
(CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative
performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended
understanding rate from 64.5% to 86.5%, and significantly reduces pronunciation
errors in the secondary language. CS3-Bench is available at

<details>

Motivation: 弱到强泛化方法虽然能扩展大语言模型，但受到弱模型输出中噪声和偏差的限制，影响其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 利用隐式奖励与对比解码的结构等价性，提出ConG框架，在预对齐和对齐后的弱模型之间进行对比解码，生成更高质量样本。

Result: 在不同模型家族上的实证结果显示ConG带来持续改进，证明其通用性和有效性。

Conclusion: ConG有潜力推进弱到强泛化研究，为通向AGI提供有前景的路径。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

Motivation: 方言主要是口语形式，非标准拼写在文本处理中存在问题，需要研究标准到方言的迁移在不同模态中的效果。

Method: 在德语和多种德语方言的意图和主题分类任务中，比较了文本模型、语音模型以及语音转文本再处理的级联系统。

Result: 语音模型在方言数据上表现最好，文本模型在标准数据上表现最佳。级联系统在德语上落后于纯文本模型，但在方言数据上如果转录系统生成标准化输出则表现相对较好。

Conclusion: 语音模型是处理方言数据的最佳选择，而级联系统在特定条件下也能在方言数据上取得不错效果。

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard
dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are
primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text
processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text
models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets
automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our
experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of
written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the
first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the
speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the
text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag
behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the
dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like
output.

Conclusion: MCBench通过客观、确定性和可代码验证的评估方法，能够有效测试LLMs在逐步执行、指令遵循和长距离一致性方面的能力。

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult
benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress
highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective
verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly
following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on
subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective,
deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to
systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution,
including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range
consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of
these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the
accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark
variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability
of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective
tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

Conclusion: 基于对内部推理机制的原则性理解，为推进知识编辑能力建立了新途径，证明值神经元的语义可解释性是由查询驱动的积累协调的。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to
update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant
performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly
acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning
chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an
oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at
the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit
subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding
value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the
final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,
we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual
Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and
edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically
grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals
more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the
semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven
accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE
capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning
mechanisms.

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop
QA benchmarks, with an 8B model achieving performance comparable to a 70B

Motivation: 大语言模型经常产生不完整或选择性省略关键信息的输出，在敏感领域这种遗漏可能造成与事实错误相当的严重危害。

Method: 研究三种自动评估策略：基于NLI的方法将文本分解为原子语句并使用自然语言推理识别缺失链接；基于问答的方法提取问答对并比较不同来源的回答；端到端方法直接使用LLM识别缺失内容。

Result: 实验表明简单的端到端方法相比更复杂的方法具有令人惊讶的有效性，但代价是降低了鲁棒性、可解释性和结果粒度。

Conclusion: 端到端方法在检测LLM生成文本完整性方面表现最佳，但需要在效果与可解释性之间权衡。

Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs
that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains,
such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by
factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the
challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing
on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We
investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that
decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference
(NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts
question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an
end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end
approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced

TL;DR: 该研究展示了大型语言模型在17-18世纪爱沙尼亚语词典研究中的应用潜力，包括词典信息半自动丰富、哥特体文字识别和跨源数据集准备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索LLMs在爱沙尼亚语历史词典数字化和丰富化中的应用，特别是针对这种小语种资源的处理效率和成本节约。

Method: 采用多种LLMs进行实验：使用Claude 3.7 Sonnet进行词典信息丰富，零样本方法进行文字识别，以及重叠拼接扫描图像文件并使用不同LLMs分别处理文字识别和结构化输出合并。

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet在提供足够上下文的情况下，为81%的词条准确提供了含义和现代对应词；零样本方法成功识别并结构化41%的词条为无错误的JSON格式输出。

Conclusion: 即使对于小语种，LLMs在节省时间和财务资源方面具有显著潜力，能够有效支持历史词典的数字化和丰富化工作。

Abstract: This article presents research conducted at the Institute of the Estonian
Language between 2022 and 2025 on the application of large language models
(LLMs) to the study of 17th and 18th century Estonian dictionaries. The authors
address three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word
forms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on
sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a
unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648
dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic
enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81%
of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732
dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of
headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the
Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping
tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text
recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings
demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for
saving time and financial resources.

TL;DR: A²Search是一个无需标注的端到端训练框架，通过轨迹采样和证据验证自动检测模糊问题并收集替代答案，使用AnsF1奖励进行强化学习优化，在多个开放域问答基准上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理允许多个有效答案的问题时表现不佳，标准QA基准通常假设单一黄金答案，忽略了问题的模糊性，产生不合适的训练信号。现有处理模糊性的方法依赖昂贵的手动标注，难以扩展到多跳数据集。

Method: 提出A²Search框架：1）通过轨迹采样和证据验证自动检测模糊问题并收集替代答案；2）使用精心设计的AnsF1奖励进行强化学习优化，该奖励自然适应多个答案。

Result: 在8个开放域QA基准上的实验表明，A²Search实现了新的最先进性能。仅使用单次rollout，A²Search-7B在四个多跳基准上的平均AnsF1@1得分为48.4%，优于所有强基线，包括更大的ReSearch-32B（46.2%）。

Conclusion: A²Search能够解决模糊性并在不同基准间泛化，表明接受模糊性对于构建更可靠的QA系统至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$
score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong
baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$).
Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and
generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is
essential for building more reliable QA systems. Our code, data, and model
weights can be found at https://github.com/zfj1998/A2Search

*Jingyuan Wang,Yankai Chen,Zhonghang Li,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightReasoner是一个新颖框架，利用小型语言模型(SLM)来指导大型语言模型(LLM)的推理能力，通过专家-业余对比识别关键推理时刻，大幅提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调(SFT)方法资源密集，需要大量标注数据，且对所有token进行统一优化，而实际上只有少数token具有重要学习价值。作者探索了反向思路：能否让小型模型揭示大型模型推理中的高价值时刻？

Method: LightReasoner采用两阶段框架：(1)采样阶段：通过专家(LLM)与业余(SLM)模型的行为差异识别关键推理时刻，构建对比监督示例；(2)微调阶段：基于这些精炼示例对齐专家模型，增强其推理优势。

Result: 在七个数学基准测试中，LightReasoner将准确率提升高达28.1%，同时减少90%的时间消耗、80%的采样问题和99%的微调token使用，且无需真实标签。

Conclusion: 通过将较弱的小型模型转化为有效的教学信号，LightReasoner为提升LLM推理能力提供了一种可扩展且资源高效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur
contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these
distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven
mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while
reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token
usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker
SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and
resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning. Code is available at:

TL;DR: LLMs在社交推理任务中表现不佳，存在认知混淆和逻辑不一致问题。作者提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，通过构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，显著提升了社交推理准确性并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学和代码推理方面表现出色，但在社交推理任务中却存在认知混淆、逻辑不一致以及客观世界状态与主观信念状态混淆的问题。

Method: 提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，动态监控推理轨迹中的混淆指标，并通过提供清晰的世界状态描述进行及时干预。

Result: 在三个社交基准测试中显示出显著改进，准确率提升（如在Hi-ToM中+10%），同时计算成本降低（最多减少33.8%的token使用）。

Conclusion: 该机制为在社交场景中部署LLMs提供了一个简单而有效的解决方案，模仿了人类使用隐式世界模型来区分外部事件和内部信念的方式。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

Motivation: 科学图表标题需要准确性和风格一致性来传达视觉信息，现有方法在结合上下文理解和作者特定写作风格方面存在不足。

Method: 两阶段流水线：第一阶段使用DSPy的MIPROv2和SIMBA进行上下文过滤和类别特定提示优化；第二阶段应用少量样本提示结合作者档案图进行风格精炼。

Result: 类别特定提示相比零样本和通用优化方法，ROUGE-1召回率提升+8.3%，精度损失限制在-2.8%，BLEU-4减少-10.9%；风格精炼使BLEU得分提升40-48%，ROUGE提升25-27%。

Conclusion: 结合上下文理解与作者特定风格适应可以生成既科学准确又风格忠实于源论文的图表标题。

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在部署到现实世界长时程任务时存在关键限制：它们是测试时静态的，无法从经验中学习，缺乏积累知识和持续改进的能力。

Method: 提出MUSE框架，围绕分层记忆模块构建经验驱动的自我进化系统，智能体在每个子任务执行后自主反思轨迹，将原始轨迹转换为结构化经验并整合回记忆模块。

Result: 在长时程生产力基准TAC上取得新的SOTA性能，仅使用轻量级Gemini-2.5 Flash模型就实现显著优势。随着经验积累，智能体展现出越来越优越的任务完成能力以及强大的持续学习和自我进化能力。

Conclusion: MUSE建立了一个能够实现现实世界生产力任务自动化的AI智能体新范式，积累的经验展现出强大的泛化特性，能够在新任务上实现零样本改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI
agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a
critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from
experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously
improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent
framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered
around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of
experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across
multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously
reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured
experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism
enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering
continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon
productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant
margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments
demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits
increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust
continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated
experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling
zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI
agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

Method: 使用简单和增强提示策略，进行文档级和句子级翻译比较，采用自动评估和基于MQM的人工评估方法。

Result: 文档级翻译优于句子级；ChatGPT-3.5在准确性上更好，ChatGPT-4在流畅性上更优；与商业翻译系统相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在日英翻译中表现出色，文档级翻译效果更好，与主流翻译系统相比具有竞争力。

Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT for Japanese-English translation, exploring
simple and enhanced prompts and comparing against commercially available

we found that document-level translation outperforms sentence-level translation
for ChatGPT. On the other hand, we were not able to determine if enhanced
prompts performed better than simple prompts in our experiments. We also
discovered that ChatGPT-3.5 was preferred by automatic evaluation, but a
tradeoff exists between accuracy (ChatGPT-3.5) and fluency (ChatGPT-4). Lastly,
ChatGPT yields competitive results against two widely-known translation
systems.

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型从参数知识中回忆气候常态的能力，发现LLMs能够编码非平凡的气候结构，但在高海拔和高纬度地区存在空间一致误差，且无法准确再现温度变化的空间模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在气候相关应用中的部署增加，理解其内部气候知识对于可靠性评估和错误信息风险分析至关重要，但目前LLMs回忆气候常态参数知识的能力尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 构建全球1度分辨率的陆地网格查询，要求LLMs回忆1991-2020年7月平均2米气温，并将响应与ERA5再分析数据验证，同时测试地理上下文信息对性能的影响。

Result: LLMs能够捕捉纬度和地形模式，均方根误差为3-6°C，偏差±1°C。但在1500米以上海拔性能急剧下降，RMSE达5-13°C。包含地理上下文信息可平均减少27%误差。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs能够捕捉当前气候分布，但无法准确表示长期温度变化的空间模式，这对理解气候动态至关重要。评估框架为量化LLMs中的参数气候知识提供了可复现基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

Result: 实验结果表明FedDTRE能够提升对话模型性能，改善对话生成质量

Conclusion: FedDTRE通过可信度评估机制有效解决了联邦学习中过拟合和全局信息遗忘的问题，提升了对话生成质量

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's

Conclusion: 推理能有效提升LLM的谈判能力，但成本高昂；多语言推理存在显著差异，开源模型的语言不一致性可能影响通过推理痕迹获得的可解释性收益。

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an
ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with
competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating
the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial
and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play
setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between
performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the
nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that
enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves
negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome
task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning
improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400
%. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning
distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their
internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus
possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of
reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language
consistency between their reasoning and final output.

Motivation: 由于每个语言模型都有自己的词汇表，它们在下一个token分布的层面上难以协作，如模型集成。

Method: 建立了一个无损词汇缩减的理论框架，通过最大公共词汇表将不同分词方案的模型进行转换。

Result: 该框架能够高效地将给定自回归语言模型转换为任意小词汇量的模型，且不损失准确性。

Conclusion: 通过最大公共词汇表，不同分词方案的语言模型可以高效协作。

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

Result: 两种模型在分类赞助内容方面表现强劲（F1达0.93），但在模糊案例中性能下降超过10个百分点。常见错误包括引用遗漏（28.57%）、模糊引用（20.71%），隐藏广告的错误率最高（28.57%）。

Conclusion: 本研究为监管合规技术提供了LLM法律推理错误的分类法，开发了由法律专业学生标注的原创数据集，并提出了结合定量和定性评估的策略，支持广告监管机构基于坚实法律基础自动化审核流程。

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic
content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating
to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal
knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of
undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as
opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and
gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels
of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying
content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over
10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning
errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references
(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While
adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not
consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is
threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology
by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to
evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally
robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing
content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated
by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it
combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM
explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support
advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid
legal foundation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM作为评判者被大规模用于替代或增强人工标注，需要理解其潜在的偏见和风险，因此需要提取可解释的全局策略。

Method: 1) CLoVE：生成可验证、基于概念的对比性局部解释；2) GloVE：通过迭代聚类、总结和验证将局部规则浓缩为全局策略。

Result: 在7个标准内容危害检测数据集上评估，提取的全局策略对LLM评判者决策高度忠实，对文本扰动和对抗攻击具有鲁棒性，用户研究显示用户对全局策略的理解和满意度良好。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效提取LLM评判者的决策逻辑，形成可解释的全局策略，有助于理解和减轻LLM作为评判者的潜在风险。

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

Motivation: LLM作为自动评估器存在判断偏好偏差，倾向于偏好自身生成的回答，这降低了评估的可靠性

Method: 基于群体投票优化的无监督多智能体协作框架，模拟客户端-服务器投票机制来优化每个客户端智能体

Result: Genii在实验中超越了基于标注判断数据训练的监督模型，且在不同客户端智能体上持续提升性能，即使使用较弱模型作为服务器智能体

Conclusion: Genii有效减轻了LLM评估模型的判断偏好偏差，证明了其有效性，且无需人工标注

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as
LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a
vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and
reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment
preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses
generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This
paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised
multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent
judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates
various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the
interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent
unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised
models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled
annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client
agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.
Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference
bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness. All codes
are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/Genii.

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on
the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to
the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end,
we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form
of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to
automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal
data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger
closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies
demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the
LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by
achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This
enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

Conclusion: 这是首个在商业对话数据上应用指令预训练的工作，为行业利用专有数据集进行领域适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生错误的拒绝，拒绝那些包含类似不安全查询术语的良性请求，这影响了模型的实用性和用户体验。

Method: 引入XSB和MS-XSB两个基准测试，使用事后解释方法识别拒绝触发词，并部署忽略词指令、提示重述和注意力引导三种轻量级方法。

Result: 实验表明这些策略显著提高了安全提示的合规性，同时保持了强大的安全保护，特别是在复杂多轮对话场景中效果明显。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可复现的框架来诊断和缓解过度拒绝问题，为更安全和更有用的LLM部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining
benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this
challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety
Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that
identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based
Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal
calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal
that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially
pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we
leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy
three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt
rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining
or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models
demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe
prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a
reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,
highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型存在"过度思考"问题，在简单任务上生成不必要的冗长推理。现有方法通常是启发式且任务特定的，缺乏通用的自适应推理框架。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，结合长度感知优化，支持多模态理解和可执行代码集成，实现跨多种格式的自适应推理。

Result: ARM2在保持与传统推理模型相当性能的同时，平均减少超过70%的token使用量。

Conclusion: ARM2提供了一个有效的自适应推理框架，在推理性能和效率之间实现了良好平衡，特别适用于多模态场景。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking''
problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some
strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties
or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific,
lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present
ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and
efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework
augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language
inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to
multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling
substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared
to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with
traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by
over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the
effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

Motivation: 现有NLP研究主要关注诗歌自动生成和摘要，但许多语言都有完善的诗歌韵律传统，这些高级文学形式为深入探究LLM的推理能力和规则遵循能力提供了机会。

Method: 设计了MetricalARGS分类法，包含Analysis（分析）、Retrieval（检索）、Generation（生成）和Support（支持）四个维度，并以泰卢固语为例展示了该分类法的实际应用。

Conclusion: MetricalARGS通过韵律诗歌的视角，为理解当前LLM的能力和局限性提供了更广阔的可能性。

Abstract: Prior NLP work studying poetry has focused primarily on automatic poem
generation and summarization. Many languages have well-studied traditions of
poetic meter which enforce constraints on a poem in terms of syllable and
phoneme patterns. Such advanced literary forms offer opportunities for probing
deeper reasoning and language understanding in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their ability to follow strict pre-requisites and rules. In this paper, we
introduce MetricalARGS, the first taxonomy of poetry-related NLP tasks designed
to evaluate LLMs on metrical poetry across four dimensions: Analysis,
Retrieval, Generation, and Support. We discuss how these tasks relate to
existing NLP tasks, addressing questions around datasets and evaluation
metrics. Taking Telugu as our example language, we illustrate how the taxonomy
can be used in practice. MetricalARGS highlights the broader possibilities for
understanding the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs through the lens
of metrical poetry.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在专业领域性能下降，传统方法依赖昂贵的参数更新且容易过拟合，需要更轻量级的解决方案。

Method: 使用训练免费的组相对策略优化，通过组内相对语义优势而非数值优势，在多轮学习中迭代提炼高质量经验知识作为token先验。

Conclusion: Training-Free GRPO是一种成本效益高的方法，能够有效解决数据稀缺和过拟合问题，为LLM智能体性能提升提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their
promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized
real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating
external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic
reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely
on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output
distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the
output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which
is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data
scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we
propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),
a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any
parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage
instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling
high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal
ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is
seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments
on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that
Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly
improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,
Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training
data and cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了函数令牌假说来解释大语言模型的工作机制：在推理过程中，函数令牌激活上下文中最具预测性的特征来指导下一个令牌预测（记忆检索）；在预训练过程中，预测函数令牌后的内容令牌会增加模型学习的特征数量并更新参数（记忆巩固）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在知识记忆、指令跟随和推理方面表现出色，但其记忆检索和巩固机制仍然缺乏深入理解。本文旨在揭示LLMs内部的工作机制。

Method: 提出函数令牌假说，将令牌分为函数令牌（如标点、冠词、介词等）和内容令牌。通过二分图分析显示少量函数令牌激活大部分特征，并通过案例研究展示函数令牌如何激活最具预测性的特征。

Result: 实验证据表明，函数令牌在推理时激活最具预测性的特征来指导预测，在预训练时预测函数令牌后的内容令牌主导训练损失，迫使函数令牌选择最具预测性的特征。

Conclusion: 函数令牌假说为理解大语言模型的记忆检索和巩固机制提供了新的理论框架，揭示了函数令牌在模型工作过程中的核心作用。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在特定领域微调LLMs可能导致广泛的诚信问题，即使只引入少量不道德数据也会显著降低模型诚实度，在真实人机交互中这种风险更加明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在微调过程中是否会出现诚信方面的广泛失调现象，特别是在高风险场景下的欺骗和不诚实行为。

Method: 对开源LLMs在不同领域进行不道德完成项的微调，包括下游混合微调设置和模拟人机交互环境。

Result: LLMs在诚信方面表现出广泛失调行为，仅引入1%的不道德数据就能使诚实行为下降20%以上，在10%偏见用户环境中模型会被无意间误导加剧不诚实。

Conclusion: 新兴失调现象不仅存在于安全行为领域，也扩展到高风险场景下的诚信和欺骗领域，这种风险不仅来自直接微调，也存在于下游任务和实际人机交互中。

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the
domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate
that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in
downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a
comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the
availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of
up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of
labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment
labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained
multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing
COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The
dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along
with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from
English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets
collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained
sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language
models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the
evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing
significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our
dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various
applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the
repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}. We anticipate that
this work will foster further exploration into fine-grained sentiment analysis
for complex events within the NLP community, promoting more nuanced
understanding and research innovations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果关系提取数据集只关注支持关系的"正因果"声明，完全忽略或错误标注反驳关系的"反因果"声明。

Method: 通过文献回顾证明反因果是不完整知识下因果推理的重要组成部分，制定严格标注指南，并在Causal News Corpus基础上增加反因果声明。

Result: 获得了Cohen's κ=0.74的高标注者一致性，证明不包含反因果关系的模型倾向于将反因果误分类为正因果。

Conclusion: 基于新数据集可以缓解这一错误，使transformer模型能够有效区分正因果和反因果关系。

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

TL;DR: WaltzRL是一个多智能体强化学习框架，通过对话智能体和反馈智能体的协作训练，在保持帮助性的同时提升LLM的安全性，减少不安全响应和过度拒绝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法存在两个问题：容易受到对抗攻击产生不安全内容，以及对敏感但良性的提示过度拒绝。当前的安全保障模型往往完全拒绝包含不安全部分的内容，这会加剧过度拒绝问题且无法为被拒绝的查询提供细致指导。

Method: 提出WaltzRL多智能体强化学习框架，将安全对齐建模为协作的正和博弈。联合训练对话智能体和反馈智能体，后者被激励提供有用建议来改进对话智能体响应的安全性和帮助性。核心是动态改进奖励(DIR)，基于对话智能体整合反馈的效果随时间演化。推理时，不安全或过度拒绝的响应会被改进而非丢弃。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的实验表明，WaltzRL显著减少了不安全响应（如WildJailbreak上从39.0%降至4.6%）和过度拒绝（OR-Bench上从45.3%降至9.9%），优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: WaltzRL通过让对话和反馈智能体共同进化并自适应应用反馈，在不降低通用能力的情况下增强了LLM安全性，从而推进了帮助性和无害性之间的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful
and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing
challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,
and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current
approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely
reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music
entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance
for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we
propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL
jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is
incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and
helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a
Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the
conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or
overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than
discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent
and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency
on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,
demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,
from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on
OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and
feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances
LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto
front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

TL;DR: 研究探讨使用对比解码生成合成语料库来训练语言模型，发现混合真实数据和对比解码生成的合成数据能提升语言建模和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练数据可能面临枯竭，需要探索使用LLM生成的合成数据作为补充训练数据源。

Method: 在控制环境中，使用对比解码方法（通过好模型和坏模型之间的相对差异）生成合成语料库，并将其与原始训练数据混合。

Result: 混合合成数据和真实数据训练能提升语言建模目标性能和下游任务表现，对比解码生成的合成数据特别有助于需要推理能力的任务。

Conclusion: 对比解码生成的合成数据是有效的训练数据补充，能针对性地提升模型在不同类型任务上的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

TL;DR: DeepMiner是一个通过高难度训练任务和动态上下文窗口来激发多轮智能体深度推理能力的新框架，在多个搜索代理基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在多轮长交互智能体中激发深度推理能力，需要解决训练数据挑战性和可靠性问题，以及长上下文处理限制。

Method: 提出逆向构建方法从真实网络源生成复杂但可验证的问答对，设计动态上下文管理策略，使用滑动窗口机制消除对外部摘要模型的依赖。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B上通过强化学习开发的DeepMiner-32B，在BrowseComp-en上达到33.5%准确率，比之前最佳开源代理提升近20个百分点，在多个基准测试中表现一致提升。

Conclusion: DeepMiner通过高难度训练和动态上下文管理，有效解决了现有多轮交互系统的上下文限制，实现了近100轮的持续交互。

Abstract: While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive
behaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to
invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon
interactions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such
abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context
window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex
but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures
the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive
capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant
yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and
inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency
on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to
handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement
learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial
performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner
attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best
open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent
improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our
dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns
within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context
limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.

TL;DR: 该论文通过神经元级分析识别驱动文化行为的神经元，发现文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元集中在浅层到中层MLP层，仅占所有神经元的不到1%。抑制这些神经元会显著降低文化基准测试性能，但对通用自然语言理解影响很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在文化偏见和对少数文化认知有限的问题，但其文化理解机制尚未充分探索，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 采用基于梯度的评分方法进行神经元级分析，通过额外过滤进行精确细化，识别文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元。

Result: 文化相关神经元集中在浅层到中层MLP层，抑制这些神经元使文化基准测试性能下降高达30%，但对通用NLU基准影响很小。文化特定神经元不仅支持目标文化知识，还支持相关文化知识。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs文化理解的内部机制，为模型训练和工程提供实用指导，发现NLU基准训练可能削弱模型的文化理解能力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring
their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs
exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while
the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To
fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that
drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with
additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general
neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and
culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account
for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP
layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially
degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance
on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely
unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge
of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we
demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural
understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons.
These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer
practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队方法依赖种子指令，限制了对抗提示的语义多样性，需要开发更有效的自由形式红队方法来评估LLM安全性。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）角色引导的对抗指令生成；2）通过反思循环迭代优化低质量提示。引入验证器在不查询目标模型的情况下评估提示有害性。

Result: 构建了AutoRed-Medium和AutoRed-Hard两个红队数据集，在八个最先进LLM上评估，AutoRed实现了更高的攻击成功率和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于种子的方法存在局限性，自由形式红队方法在LLM安全评估中具有巨大潜力，将开源数据集。

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of
trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed
instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized
adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt
generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed
operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,
and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve
efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without
querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --
AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.
AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than
existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based
approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM
safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球自杀率上升，社交媒体提供重要信号，但隐晦自杀意念检测困难，现有模型要么效率低要么准确性不足。

Method: 两阶段架构：第一阶段BERT快速处理高置信度明确案例；第二阶段对模糊输入采用多视角LLM投票或基于LLM提取心理特征的机器学习集成。

Result: 在两个数据集上表现优异：明确案例F1达98.0%，隐晦案例99.7%，跨领域差距低于2%，同时显著降低LLM成本。

Conclusion: 该框架在自杀风险检测中平衡了效率与准确性，是首个将LLM提取的心理特征作为结构化向量用于此任务的工作。

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent
need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable
signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to
stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit
suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle
emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle
explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models
(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,
we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and
robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves
high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to
either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on
implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by
psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for
efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as
structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -
explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework
outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%
on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while
significantly lowering LLM cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去研究主要关注ICL中演示表示的重要性，但对学习能力的研究结果不一。本文旨在深入探讨表示和学习这两个方面在ICL中的相互作用关系。

Method: 开发优化算法枚举不同语义相关性的标签集，然后对每个标签集使用不同数量的上下文演示进行ICL实验。

Result: 无论标签集质量如何，学习都会发生，但学习效率受标签集质量和语言模型参数数量的影响。表示质量在整个学习过程中保持相对稳定。

Conclusion: ICL中的表示和学习具有正交性，表示决定基线性能，学习在此基础上独立提升，揭示了ICL中一个未被充分探索的方面。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件可接受性在沟通和推理中很重要，但现有研究不清楚LLMs如何判断条件语句的可接受性，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 使用线性混合效应模型和ANOVA测试，分析不同模型家族、规模和提示策略下LLMs的条件可接受性判断。

Result: 模型对条件概率和语义相关性都敏感，但敏感程度因架构和提示风格而异；与人类数据比较显示LLMs使用概率和语义线索不如人类一致；更大模型不一定更接近人类判断。

Conclusion: LLMs在条件可接受性判断中整合了概率和语义信息，但与人类存在系统性差异，模型规模不是改善对齐性的关键因素。

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is
perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as
it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and
make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how
acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by
two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and
the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent
$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has
examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional
statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the
$\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across
different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear
mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both
conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees
depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data
reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so
less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align
more closely with human judgments.

Method: 使用Co⁴架构，仅包含单层、两个注意力头和800万参数，采用近似O(N)的计算复杂度，相比传统Transformer的O(N²)复杂度更高效。

Result: 在10M token上训练2个epoch即超越GPT-2(124M)和GPT-BERT(30M)训练10个epoch的结果。在SuperGLUE任务中，零样本和微调性能均优于基准模型，在多数指标上表现更好。

Conclusion: 结果表明需要重新思考当前深度学习范式和扩展定律，简化模型结构可以实现更高的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two
heads, and 8M parameters, operating at an approximate cost of $O(N)$ (where $N$
is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2
(124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two
epochs, while both are trained for ten. Co$^4$ achieves orders-of-magnitude
greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample
efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across
complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out
of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out
of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink
prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

Result: ARES在多样化数学、逻辑和多模态基准测试中实现了优越性能和推理效率，在显著降低推理成本的同时缩小了与领先商业系统的差距。

Conclusion: ARES框架通过自适应推理策略有效平衡了简单和困难问题的推理努力分配，提高了多模态大推理模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have
substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks.
However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging
ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,
a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically
allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is
motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is
noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a
sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)
reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for
solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage
training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and
textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem
difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the
second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a
hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to
explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior
performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and
multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems
under significantly lower inference costs.

Result: 任务吸引了多样化的参与，结果揭示了建模变异方法的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: 这些贡献加强了LEWIDI作为框架的作用，为开发分歧感知技术提供了新资源、基准和发现。

Abstract: Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained
to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human
judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The
LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to
promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable
datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third
edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to
four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm
detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include
not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments
as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to
evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models
predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist
approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.
Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested
new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse
participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and
limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions
strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and
findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

Motivation: 并行扩展虽然能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但会产生大量冗余计算——超过80%的并行推理轨迹产生相同的最终答案，造成计算浪费。

Method: 提出DeepPrune框架，包含：1）使用焦点损失和过采样技术训练的专业判断模型，用于从部分推理轨迹预测答案等价性；2）在线贪心聚类算法，动态剪枝冗余路径同时保持答案多样性。

Result: 在三个挑战性基准测试（AIME 2024、AIME 2025和GPQA）上，DeepPrune相比传统共识采样实现了超过80%的token减少，同时准确率保持在3个百分点以内。

Conclusion: DeepPrune为高效并行推理设立了新标准，使高性能推理更加高效。

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces
significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

Motivation: 受人类创造新词表达新概念的启发，研究如何通过引入新词汇来更好地理解和控制语言模型，扩展最近提出的新词学习方法。

Method: 通过添加新词嵌入并训练包含该概念的示例，不改变其他模型参数。引入插件评估来验证自述效果，并探索机器专用同义词。

Conclusion: 新词学习是一种有效的模型理解和控制方法，能通过自述揭示模型内部表示，并为多概念学习提供新途径。

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful
concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our
communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control
the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This
method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with
examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We
show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,
incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We
discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via
self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in
natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of
incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful
answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:
we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it
controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only
synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in
machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple
concepts in multiple words.

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to systematically refine prompts to enhance a
language model's performance on specific tasks. Fairness detection in Terms of
Service (ToS) clauses is a challenging legal NLP task that demands carefully
crafted prompts to ensure reliable results. However, existing prompt
optimization methods are often computationally expensive due to inefficient
search strategies and costly prompt candidate scoring. In this paper, we
propose a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy
prompt evaluator to more effectively explore the prompt space while reducing
evaluation costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves higher
classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under a
constrained computation budget.

TL;DR: 提出了RLKV框架，使用强化学习识别推理模型中对链式思维推理至关重要的注意力头，对这些关键头保留完整KV缓存，对其他头应用压缩缓存，实现20-50%的缓存减少且性能几乎无损。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法在推理模型上表现不佳：token丢弃方法会破坏推理完整性，而头重分配方法错误压缩了推理关键头，导致性能显著下降。

Method: 提出RLKV框架，使用强化学习直接优化每个头的缓存使用与推理质量的关系，识别推理关键头。对关键头保留完整KV缓存，对其他头应用压缩的常数KV缓存。

Result: 实验表明只有少量注意力头对推理至关重要，RLKV在实现20-50%缓存减少的同时，性能几乎无损，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RLKV成功识别了推理模型中的功能异质性，通过选择性压缩实现了高效的KV缓存管理，为推理模型的部署提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through
the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV)
cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods
underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning
integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods
mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for
retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as
compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional
heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought
consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this
insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification
framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the
relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV
produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally
identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV
cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for
efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of
attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression
approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction
with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

TL;DR: CoMAS是一个新颖的多智能体协同进化框架，通过智能体间的互动讨论产生内在奖励，使用LLM作为评判机制，并通过强化学习优化策略，实现无外部监督的自主进化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的自我进化方法依赖于外部密集奖励信号或LLM自身的内在奖励，这与人类通过相互讨论和协作进行学习改进的机制不符。

Method: CoMAS框架通过智能体间的互动讨论生成内在奖励，采用LLM-as-a-judge机制制定这些奖励，并通过强化学习优化每个智能体的策略，实现去中心化和可扩展的协同进化。

Result: 实验结果显示CoMAS在大多数评估设置中持续优于未经训练的智能体，并达到最先进的性能。消融研究证实了基于互动的奖励信号的必要性，并显示出随着智能体数量和多样性增加的良好可扩展性。

Conclusion: CoMAS为基于LLM的智能体自我进化提供了一个新颖且有效的范式，通过模拟人类协作学习机制实现了更好的进化效果。

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

Result: 在数学问题解决、常识推理和安全领域应用表明，该框架能产生经过验证、多样且公平的更新，发现新的失败模式，提高难度同时保持测试目标一致性，改善模型可区分性。

Conclusion: 该框架为基准测试随基础模型快速发展提供了一条可扩展的持续进化路径。

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.
