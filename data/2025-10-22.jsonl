Two well-studied examples are $f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity\nand Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity. The former shares the same\nvacuum solutions as General Relativity, including black holes, while the latter\nsuffers from well-posedness issues due to quadratic curvature terms in the\nstrong-coupling regime.

This construction naturally extends EdGB\ngravity to include arbitrary higher-curvature terms, providing a versatile\nsetting to address fundamental questions. Focusing on quadratic and quartic\ncorrections, we find that: (i) black holes are modified by $f(\\mathcal{R})$\nterms, unlike the case without Gauss-Bonnet interactions; (ii) the resulting\nsolutions retain the qualitative nonperturbative features of EdGB black holes\nwith certain couplings, such as a minimum mass and multiple branches; (iii) a\nnontrivial mechanism suppresses the divergence of the Ricci scalar in the\nblack-hole interior; (iv) still, even with quartic corrections, the singularity\nstructure and elliptic regions inside the horizon remain similar to those of\npure EdGB gravity.

The improvement arises from stochastic difference\nlatent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM\nunderestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM\nachieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing\nits advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis\nto Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the\nsampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.\nThe approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component\nmeans increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well\nseparated.

CAD is enabled by two observations.\nFirst, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only\nminimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks.\nSecond, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when\nprocessing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD\npartitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to\ndedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize\ncompute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system\ncalled DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap\ncommunication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to\nreduce memory use.

In the case of graph learning, the attack\nmodel usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or\ninstead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art\ntechniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on\ntop of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming.

In this work, we propose\nOmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather\nforecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model\nthat encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent\nspace, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of\nfuture latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we\nmask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their\ndistribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion\nhead. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future\ntokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens.

In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses and\nis immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highly\nefficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and uses\njust one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achieves\ndownstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable\nto strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such as\nGRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of\nOSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existing\npreference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads to\nreasoning ability improvement.

However, RLVR highly depends on\nwell-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide\naccurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL\nscaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent\nworks explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks\ncan hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To\nachieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for\ndeep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine\ncalling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.\nThe task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined\nground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries\nto handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer\npredictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground\ntruth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as\nexternal knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to\ntest whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary\nsearch documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer\nand the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and\ncooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can\nsignificantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various\nbenchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL\ntraining setups.

However, their use has\ntraditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on\nestimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action\nspaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes\ncomputationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically\nemployed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,\nand an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their\npopularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In\nthis work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control\nthat revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key\narchitectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.\nWe evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard\nsimulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with\nstate-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.\nParticularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value\nfunctions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization\noutperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.\nWe have released our code at https://github.com/USC-Lira/Q3C."}

In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for\nmitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns\nof two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\nreinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across\nLM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,\nand arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving\ncomparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this\ndifference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a\nmixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the\nother to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which\nstems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact\nwhen learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating\nthat the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in\npractical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL\nregularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our\nresults highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately\non-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully\non-policy data."}
