This reconstruction\nenables a first principles description of atom field interaction via the multi\nmode Jaynes Cummings model in open and dissipative environments. Within the\nsingle excitation manifold, we show that the memory kernel of a two level\nsystem is determined by the imaginary part of the Greens function, implying\nthat radiative modes alone govern the relevant dynamics. The proposed framework\nthus provides a Greens function based approach for describing atomic population\nand single photon dynamics, directly compatible with Maxwell solvers.

For instance, repeated\nuse may reduce an action's effectiveness (habituation), while inactivity may\nrestore it (recovery). These nonstationarities are captured by the Reducing or\nGaining Unknown Efficacy (ROGUE) bandit framework, which models real-world\nsettings such as behavioral health interventions. While existing algorithms can\ncompute sublinear regret policies to optimize these settings, they may not\nprovide sufficient exploration due to overemphasis on exploitation, limiting\nthe ability to estimate population-level effects. This is a challenge of\nparticular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in\ndeveloping just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level\neffects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In\nthis paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored\nto the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret.\nWe then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization\nand population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret\nand minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning\nphysical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our\nmethods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high\nstatistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly\nincreasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while\naccounting for individual behavioral dynamics.

Using the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the\nconditions under which unstable circular orbit and the associated homoclinic\ntrajectory arise, marking the separatrix between bound and plunging motion. By\nanalyzing the effective potential and the corresponding phase-space structure,\nwe identify the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics in the near-horizon\nregion. Numerical analyses through Poincare sections and Lyapunov exponents\ncalculations demonstrate that increasing the halo density, scale radius along\nwith energy amplifies nonlinear effects which leads to chaos eventually. We\ndemonstrate that within a dark matter halo environment, the dynamical stability\nof particle motion can be significantly altered without violating the universal\nsurface gravity bound on chaos.

Given a\nproperty predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a\ngenerative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to\nconcentrate on designs with the desired properties.

Extensive experiments show that DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35%\nand an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers\nand recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that\nSentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over\nalternative encoders, and integrating the OFC loss yields an additional 0.98%\ngain compared to standard contrastive objectives. In conclusion, our system\nseamlessly routes user queries to task-specific modules (e.g., ETA information,\ntraffic risk evaluation, and other typical scenarios in the transportation\ndomain), laying the groundwork for fully autonomous, intention-aware agents\nwithout costly manual labelling."}

Jordan", "Francis Bach"], "title": "Structured Matrix Scaling for Multi-Class Calibration", "comment": null, "summary": "Post-hoc recalibration methods are widely used to ensure that classifiers\nprovide faithful probability estimates. We argue that parametric recalibration\nfunctions based on logistic regression can be motivated from a simple\ntheoretical setting for both binary and multiclass classification. This insight\nmotivates the use of more expressive calibration methods beyond standard\ntemperature scaling. For multi-class calibration however, a key challenge lies\nin the increasing number of parameters introduced by more complex models, often\ncoupled with limited calibration data, which can lead to overfitting. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting bias-variance tradeoff\ncan be effectively managed by structured regularization, robust preprocessing\nand efficient optimization. The resulting methods lead to substantial gains\nover existing logistic-based calibration techniques. We provide efficient and\neasy-to-use open-source implementations of our methods, making them an\nattractive alternative to common temperature, vector, and matrix scaling\nimplementations."}

We introduce Behavior-Adaptive\nQ-Learning (BAQ), a framework designed to enable a smooth and reliable\ntransition from offline to online RL. The key idea is to leverage an implicit\nbehavioral model derived from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency\nsignal during online fine-tuning. BAQ incorporates a dual-objective loss that\n(i) aligns the online policy toward the offline behavior when uncertainty is\nhigh, and (ii) gradually relaxes this constraint as more confident online\nexperience is accumulated. This adaptive mechanism reduces error propagation\nfrom out-of-distribution estimates, stabilizes early online updates, and\naccelerates adaptation to new scenarios. Across standard benchmarks, BAQ\nconsistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches, achieving\nfaster recovery, improved robustness, and higher overall performance. Our\nresults demonstrate that implicit behavior adaptation is a principled and\npractical solution for reliable real-world policy deployment."}

Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process,\nresulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of\nAI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to\nautomate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical\nbottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of\nexplainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of\nthe tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for\nsample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs\na multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based\nagents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design\ngoals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the\ntarget goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation\nstrategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.\nThe AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity\nand is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from\npure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system\nlearns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate\nconvergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog\ndesign space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents\nserve as transparent design assistants."}

Under Review", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a\npowerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using\npolicy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods\ntypically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each\nprompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline),\nreducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator.\n  Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages\nfor each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we\npropose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt\nmeans to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy --\nparticularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we\nconstruct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance\npolicy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a\ndrop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no\nadditional hyper-parameters or computation. Empirically, shrinkage baselines\nconsistently outperform standard empirical-mean baselines, leading to\nlower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability."}

It also raises concerns over the\nscalability of these approaches, as dimensionality reduction methods are slow\nto adapt to large datasets. In this article, we analyze how data reduction\nmethods affect different QML models. We conduct this experiment over several\ngenerated datasets, quantum machine algorithms, quantum data encoding methods,\nand data reduction methods. All these models were evaluated on the performance\nmetrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our findings have led\nus to conclude that the usage of data dimensionality reduction methods results\nin skewed performance metric values, which results in wrongly estimating the\nactual performance of quantum machine learning models. There are several\nfactors, along with data dimensionality reduction methods, that worsen this\nproblem, such as characteristics of the datasets, classical to quantum\ninformation embedding methods, percentage of feature reduction, classical\ncomponents associated with quantum models, and structure of quantum machine\nlearning models.
