While the optical frequency comb revolutionized timekeeping by discretizing the continuum of light into countable teeth, and the Quantum Hall Effect standardized resistance via topological invariants, a comparable standard for interaction strength remains elusive. Currently, measuring the coupling constant ($g$) between quantum systems is an estimation problem, inherently subject to drift, noise, and fabrication variance. Here, we introduce Interaction Metrology, a protocol that transforms the measurement of coupling strengths from an analog estimation into a topological counting problem. By engineering a specific class of algebraic catastrophe -- the Unimodal $X_9$ singularity -- in a driven-dissipative lattice, we prove that the system's interaction moduli are topologically forced to take discrete, quantized values, forming a \"Geometric $k$-Comb.\" We derive the universality class of this quantization, showing that it arises from the discrepancy between the Milnor ($μ$) and Tjurina ($τ$) numbers of the effective potential, a strictly non-Hermitian effect forbidden in standard quantum mechanics. Finally, we provide an ab-initio blueprint for a silicon nitride implementation, demonstrating that this quantization is robust against disorder levels exceeding current foundry tolerances. This discovery establishes a universal standard for force sensing and quantum logic gates, enabling the calibration of interaction strengths with topological certainty."}

In such molecules, each CH_2 group must have a distinct chemical shift and be magnetically inequivalent via out-of-pair couplings. Under these conditions, singlet state populations of geminal protons propagate along (CH_2)_n segments forming magnetically silent spin waves. For a chain with translational symmetry, the spin Hamiltonian factorizes into subspaces formally equivalent to the one-dimensional XY model. This correspondence yields analytic expressions for eigenstates and eigenenergies in a spectroscopy we term spin-chain zero-quantum NMR.

Classical density functional theory (cDFT) provides a first-principles route to connect microscopic interactions with macroscopic observables, but its predictive accuracy depends on approximate free-energy functionals that are difficult to generalize. Here we introduce a physics-informed learning framework that augments cDFT with neural corrections trained directly against molecular-dynamics data through adjoint optimization. Rather than replacing the theory with a black-box surrogate, we embed compact neural networks within the Helmholtz free-energy functional, learning local and nonlocal corrections that preserve thermodynamic consistency while capturing missing correlations. Applied to Lennard-Jones fluids, the resulting augmented excess free-energy functional quantitatively reproduces equilibrium density profiles, coexistence curves, and surface tensions across a broad temperature range, and accurately predicts contact angles and droplet shapes far beyond the training regime. This approach combines the interpretability of statistical mechanics with the adaptability of modern machine learning, establishing a general route to learned thermodynamic functionals that bridge molecular simulations and continuum-scale models."}

This paper examines under which conditions a classical fluid model may reproduce the most basic mathematical formalism of both theories. By assuming that the angular momentum of an irrotational vortex in an inviscid, barotropic, isothermal fluid with sound speed c is equal in magnitude to the reduced Planck constant, and incorporating Korteweg capillary stress, a complex wave equation describing the momentum and continuity equations of a Euler-Korteweg vortex is obtained. When uniform convection is introduced, the weak field approximation of this wave equation is equivalent to Schrödinger's equation. The model is shown to yield classical analogues to de Broglie wavelength, the Einstein-Planck relation, the Born rule and the uncertainty principle. Accounting for the retarded propagation of the wavefield of a vortex in convection produces the Lorentz transformation and the Klein-Gordon equation, with Schrödinger's equation appearing as the low-Mach-number limit. These results demonstrate that, under explicit assumptions, a classical continuum can reproduce the mathematical formalism of quantum and relativistic theory in their simplest form, without assuming the postulates principal to those theories."}

The approach is demonstrated using analytic simulations with the default.gaussian backend of PennyLane, where quantum states are represented by first and second moments and optimized end-to-end via automatic differentiation. Gaussian loss is modeled as a beam splitter interaction with an environmental vacuum mode of transmissivity $η\\in [0.3,0.95]$, while non-Gaussian phase noise is incorporated through a differentiable Monte-Carlo mixture of random phase rotations with jitter amplitudes $δ\\in [0,0.7]$. The core architecture employs a multi-mode Gaussian circuit consisting of a signal, ancilla, and environment mode. Input states are prepared using squeezing and displacement operations with parameters $(r_s,\\varphi_s,α)=(0.60,0.30,0.80)$ and $(r_a,\\varphi_a)=(0.40,0.10)$, followed by an entangling beam splitter with angles $(θ,φ)=(0.70,0.20)$. Error mitigation is achieved by appending a six-parameter trainable Gaussian recovery layer comprising local phase rotations and displacements, optimized by minimizing a quadratic loss on the signal-mode quadratures $\\langle \\hat{x}_0\\rangle$ and $\\langle \\hat{p}_0\\rangle$ using gradient descent with fixed learning rate $0.06$ and identical initialization across experiments. Under pure Gaussian loss, the optimized recovery suppresses reconstruction error to near machine precision ($<10^{-30}$) for moderate loss ($η\\ge 0.5$). When non-Gaussian phase noise is present, noise-aware training using Monte Carlo averaging yields robust generalization, reducing error by more than an order of magnitude compared to Gaussian-trained recovery at large phase jitter.

However, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of BMH systems are often limited by computation, communication, and memory costs. We recently proposed the random batch sum-of-Gaussians (RBSOG) method, which accelerates Coulomb calculations by using a sum-of-Gaussians (SOG) decomposition to split the potential into short- and long-range parts and by applying importance sampling in Fourier space for the long-range part. In this work, we extend the RBSOG to BMH systems and incorporate a random batch list (RBL) scheme to further accelerate the short-range part, yielding a unified framework for efficient simulations with the BMH potential. The combination of the SOG decomposition and the RBL enables an efficient and scalable treatment of both long- and short-range interactions in BMH system, particularly the RBL well handles the medium-range exponential repulsion and dispersion by the random batch neighbor list. Error estimate is provided to show the theoretical convergence of the RBL force. We evaluate the framework on molten NaCl and mixed alkali halide with up to $5\\times10^6$ atoms on $2048$ CPU cores.

However, by relaxing the stationarity condition on the metric, it has been shown that oscillatory solitonic solutions -- known as oscillatons -- exist. Oscillatons share several properties with boson stars, including comparable compactness and mass ranges. However, their time-dependent nature can lead to potentially discriminating observable signatures. In this work, we explore the observational properties of oscillatons. We find that stable oscillatory circular orbits exist, extending down to the center of the configuration, supporting the possibility of accretion disk structures within the star. We compute the deflection of light rays and verify that it is largely insensitive to the time dependence of the metric. Despite this, the oscillatory behavior of the redshift factor has a strong effect on the observed intensity profiles from accretion disks, producing a breathing-like image whose frequency depends on the mass of the scalar field. In fact, their oscillation period may lie within the observational windows of the Event Horizon Telescope for Sgr A$^{*}$ and M87$^{*}$, suggesting the possibility that this ``twinkling\" behavior could be tested via near-horizon imaging of these objects."}

In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on 16 state-of-the-art DL model fixing approaches, spanning model-level, layer-level, and neuron-level categories, to comprehensively evaluate their performance. We assess not only their fixing effectiveness (their primary purpose) but also their impact on other critical properties, such as robustness, fairness, and backward compatibility. To ensure comprehensive and fair evaluation, we employ a diverse set of datasets, model architectures, and application domains within a uniform experimental setup for experimentation. We summarize several key findings with implications for both industry and academia. For example, model-level approaches demonstrate superior fixing effectiveness compared to others. No single approach can achieve the best fixing performance while improving accuracy and maintaining all other properties. Thus, academia should prioritize research on mitigating these side effects.

The efficiency of our simulation method is rooted in a curious fact: every circuit-level Pauli error in these protocols propagates to a Clifford error at the end. This property is satisfied by a large family of protocols, including those that repeatedly measure a transversal Clifford that squares to a Pauli. We provide a proof-of-principle numerical simulation that prepares a magic state using such logical Clifford measurements.

We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors.

Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components.

However, quantum hardware roadmaps indicate that physical qubit numbers will remain limited in the foreseeable future, leading to residual logical errors that limit the size and accuracy of achievable computations. Recent work suggested logical error mitigation (LEM), which applies known error mitigation (EM) methods to logical errors, eliminating their effect at the cost of a runtime overhead. Improving the efficiency of LEM is crucial for increasing the logical circuit volumes it enables to execute.\n  We introduce syndrome-aware logical error mitigation (SALEM), which makes use of the syndrome data measured during error correction, when mitigating the logical errors. The runtime overhead of SALEM is exponentially lower than that of previously proposed LEM schemes, resulting in significantly increased circuit volumes that can be executed accurately. Notably, relative to the routinely used combination of error correction and syndrome rejection (post-selection), SALEM increases the size of reliably executable computations by orders of magnitude. In this practical setting in which space and time are both resources that need to be optimized, our work reveals a surprising phenomenon: SALEM, which tightly combines EC with EM, can outperform physical EM even above the standard fault-tolerance threshold. Thus, SALEM can make use of EC in regimes of physical error rates at which EC is commonly deemed useless."}

Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models."}

We investigate whether this geometric signature persists in production-grade language models. Across Pythia, Phi-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, we find that last-layer value representations organize along a single dominant axis whose position strongly correlates with predictive entropy, and that domain-restricted prompts collapse this structure into the same low-dimensional manifolds observed in synthetic settings.\n  To probe the role of this geometry, we perform targeted interventions on the entropy-aligned axis of Pythia-410M during in-context learning. Removing or perturbing this axis selectively disrupts the local uncertainty geometry, whereas matched random-axis interventions leave it intact. However, these single-layer manipulations do not produce proportionally specific degradation in Bayesian-like behavior, indicating that the geometry is a privileged readout of uncertainty rather than a singular computational bottleneck. Taken together, our results show that modern language models preserve the geometric substrate that enables Bayesian inference in wind tunnels, and organize their approximate Bayesian updates along this substrate."}

Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone. We discuss extensions of this approach to higher-dimensional Burgers systems and more general quantum partial differential equation solvers, highlighting learned error mitigation as a promising complement to physics-based noise reduction techniques on NISQ devices."}

We theoretically characterize this behavior and analyze how different evidential activations influence learning dynamics. Building on this analysis, we design a general family of activation functions and corresponding evidential regularizers that provide an alternative pathway for consistent evidence updates across activation regimes.

We show that the underlying fermionic structure leads to state-dependent modifications of the Heisenberg--Robertson uncertainty bound, which may fall below the canonical bosonic limit without implying any violation of uncertainty principles. Numerical results based on finite-dimensional matrix representations illustrate how these effects constrain the attainable squeezing.

Building on this idea, we develop a theoretical framework describing a non-inertial observer equipped with a detector undergoing non-uniform, time-dependent acceleration. We show that, in a non-uniformly accelerated Rindler spacetime, the particle distribution perceived in the Minkowski vacuum acquires a time-dependent modification of the standard Unruh spectrum.

Yet, conventional treatments based on asymptotic expansions suffer from divergences and become unreliable near the optical axis. In this work, we present a rigorous calculation of GW scattering by a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) within the BH perturbation theory. By placing the observer at a finite distance and abandoning the asymptotic expansion of radial wave functions, we obtain a well-convergent partial-wave description without invoking any regularization scheme, thereby naturally resolving the divergences of the partial-wave series and the Poisson spot. We numerically computed the scattered GW waveforms by reconstructing the physical $+$ and $\\times$ polarizations from the master variables, revealing the formation of the Poisson spot and pronounced wavefront distortions. A systematic comparison with conventional asymptotic approaches shows that they reproduce only qualitative features at large scattering angles and fail in the forward-scattering region. We further compare the frequency-domain transmission factors derived from the scattering formalism with those obtained from the Kirchhoff diffraction integral, finding significant discrepancies at high frequencies due to the latter's neglect of long-range gravitational effects and polarization evolution. Our results establish a stable and physically transparent framework for GW scattering in strong-field regimes and provide a solid foundation for accurate modeling of GW lensing beyond standard approximations."}

MUSIC employs mesh-free (random) sampling of training data and sparsity regularization, yielding highly compressed models with improved training and evaluation efficiency. We demonstrate that MUSIC accurately learns solutions (shock wave solutions, discontinuous solutions, pattern formation solutions) to complex coupled systems under data-scarce and noisy conditions, consistently outperforming non-sparse formulations. These results highlight MUSIC as a flexible and effective approach for modeling partially observed systems with incomplete physical knowledge."}

The Fourier transform appears as a fibrewise unitary transition function, so that the standard position-momentum duality is made precise as a change of coordinates on a single geometric object.

Each gate is compared within an algebraically consistent subgroup using a task-conditioned $q$-overlap distance, which measures functional similarity through state overlaps on a task-relevant ensemble. A gate is removed only when its replacement by a subgroup representative provably induces a bounded deviation on all task observables.\n  We establish three rigorous theoretical guarantees. First, we prove completeness of redundancy pruning: no gate that violates the prescribed similarity threshold is removed. Second, we show that the pruned circuit is functionally equivalent up to an explicit, task-conditioned error bound, with a closed-form dependence on the redundancy tolerance and the number of replaced gates. Third, we prove that the pruning procedure is computationally feasible, requiring only polynomial-time comparisons and avoiding exponential enumeration over the Hilbert space.\n  To adapt pruning decisions to hardware imperfections, we introduce a noise-calibrated deformation parameter $λ$ that modulates the $q$-geometry and redundancy tolerance.

When datasets are represented by subspaces, these representatives become points on the Grassmann or flag manifold, with distances induced by their geometry, often via principal angles. We introduce a subspace clustering algorithm that replaces subspace means with a trainable prototype defined as a Schubert Variety of Best Fit (SVBF) - a subspace that comes as close as possible to intersecting each cluster member in at least one fixed direction. Integrated in the Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) pipeline, this SVBF-LBG scheme yields improved cluster purity on synthetic, image, spectral, and video action data, while retaining the mathematical structure required for downstream analysis."}

Model recovery (MR), which identifies governing equations from sensor data, is a key primitive for safe and explainable monitoring in mission-critical autonomous systems operating under strict latency, compute, and power constraints. However, state-of-the-art MR methods (e.g., EMILY and PINN+SR) rely on Neural ODE formulations that require iterative solvers and are difficult to accelerate efficiently on edge hardware. We present \\textbf{MERINDA} (Model Recovery in Reconfigurable Dynamic Architecture), an FPGA-accelerated MR framework designed to make physical AI practical on resource-constrained devices. MERINDA replaces expensive Neural ODE components with a hardware-friendly formulation that combines (i) GRU-based discretized dynamics, (ii) dense inverse-ODE layers, (iii) sparsity-driven dropout, and (iv) lightweight ODE solvers. The resulting computation is structured for streaming parallelism, enabling critical kernels to be fully parallelized on the FPGA.

SB-TRPO adaptively biases policy updates towards constraint satisfaction while still seeking reward improvement. Concretely, it performs trust-region updates using a convex combination of the natural policy gradients of cost and reward, ensuring a fixed fraction of optimal cost reduction at each step. We provide a theoretical guarantee of local progress towards safety, with reward improvement when gradients are suitably aligned. Experiments on standard and challenging Safety Gymnasium tasks show that SB-TRPO consistently achieves the best balance of safety and meaningful task completion compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

This issue can be solved by using a method of parametric amplification of squeezed state \\cite{OPA}. In this work, we implement multi-phase estimation with optical parametric amplification of entanglement generated from squeezed states. We find multi-phase estimation sensitivity is robust against loss or detection inefficiency, where we use two-mode Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled state and four-mode cluster state for analysis.

Through analytic treatment and numerical verification, we demonstrate that these images encode not only phase transition information but also ensemble information, including additional temperature information in the isothermal ensemble. Phase transition information appears as a sudden increase in image size, which we prove occurs in both isobaric and isothermal ensembles. The ensemble and temperature information originates from a fundamental difference between isobaric and isothermal evolution: image size varies monotonically with the horizon radius along isobars, whereas it exhibits nonmonotonic behavior along isotherms. This contrast serves as a diagnostic tool to distinguish isobaric from isothermal evolution. In the isothermal ensemble, the nonmonotonic behavior introduces an extremal radius whose relative ordering with the small- and large-black hole radii at the phase transition admits three logical possibilities. Our analysis reveals that only two of these possibilities are physically realized, separated by a critical reduced temperature. Furthermore, image evolution in the two resulting temperature intervals exhibits qualitatively differences, demonstrating that black hole images indeed encode temperature information. These results not only enrich the set of observational avenues for probing black hole thermodynamic properties, but also introduce a new paradigm. This paradigm studies phase transitions in conjunction with nonmonotonic evolution, providing a useful framework for exploring thermodynamic imprints in other black hole systems."}

RL has been widely applied in various quantitative tasks. However, most methods focus on the spot and could not be directly applied to the futures market with high leverage because of 2 challenges. First, high leverage amplifies reward fluctuations, making training stochastic and difficult to converge. Second, prior works lacked self-awareness of capability boundaries, exposing them to the risk of significant loss when encountering new market state (e.g.,a black swan event like COVID-19). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading (FineFT), a novel three-stage ensemble RL framework with stable training and proper risk management. In stage I, ensemble Q learners are selectively updated by ensemble TD errors to improve convergence. In stage II, we filter the Q-learners based on their profitabilities and train VAEs on market states to identify the capability boundaries of the learners. In stage III, we choose from the filtered ensemble and a conservative policy, guided by trained VAEs, to maintain profitability and mitigate risk with new market states. Through extensive experiments on crypto futures in a high-frequency trading environment with high fidelity and 5x leverage, we demonstrate that FineFT outperforms 12 SOTA baselines in 6 financial metrics, reducing risk by more than 40% while achieving superior profitability compared to the runner-up. Visualization of the selective update mechanism shows that different agents specialize in distinct market dynamics, and ablation studies certify routing with VAEs reduces maximum drawdown effectively, and selective update improves convergence and performance."}

We find that moderate positive anisotropy can increase the maximum supported mass up to approximately $2.4\\;M_\\odot$ and enhance stellar compactness by up to $20\\%$ relative to isotropic configurations, while remaining broadly consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints.\n  To probe the internal gravitational field, we compute curvature invariants including the Ricci scalar, the Ricci tensor contraction, the Kretschmann scalar, and the Weyl scalar. We show that curvature measures directly tied to the matter distribution exhibit a strong sensitivity to anisotropy, whereas the Weyl curvature remains comparatively insensitive, reflecting its role as a measure of the free gravitational field.

This mechanism imposes a fundamental trade-off among storage capacity, storage time, and driving time, setting a universal limit for reliable storage. Extending the analysis to memory based devices operating with multiple storage processes shows that enhancing parameter independence improves their reliability. We further provide a more precise relation for measuring and correcting global detuning, which is directly relevant to current experimental protocols."}

The quantum zero-mode of the Hamiltonian constraint, obtained from a perturbative gauge-invariant canonical analysis, is explicitly imposed on a class of quantum states whose wavefunctions factorize into a background and a perturbative part, related through a geometric relational variable. These states naturally describe regimes with small perturbative backreaction and lead to an effective Hamiltonian and associated dynamics for the perturbations. The resulting equations take the form of Regge-Wheeler equations modified by expectation values of the quantum black hole geometry, providing a clear characterization of quantum corrections to the classical description of the black hole interior.

Moreover, existing SSMs struggle to capture multi-scale dependencies, which are essential for modeling complex structures in time series, images, and natural language. This paper introduces a multi-scale SSM framework that addresses these limitations by representing sequence dynamics across multiple resolution and processing each resolution with specialized state-space dynamics. By capturing both fine-grained, high-frequency patterns and coarse, global trends, MS-SSM enhances memory efficiency and long-range modeling. We further introduce an input-dependent scale-mixer, enabling dynamic information fusion across resolutions. The proposed approach significantly improves sequence modeling, particularly in long-range and hierarchical tasks, while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, including Long Range Arena, hierarchical reasoning, time series classification, and image recognition, demonstrate that MS-SSM consistently outperforms prior SSM-based models, highlighting the benefits of multi-resolution processing in state-space architectures."}

However, as their prior is not informative to the ground-truth target, their generation process inevitably suffer increased burden and limited imputation accuracy. In this work, we present Bridge-TS, building a data-to-data generation process for generative time series imputation and exploiting the design of prior with two novel designs. Firstly, we propose expert prior, leveraging a pretrained transformer-based module as an expert to fill the missing values with a deterministic estimation, and then taking the results as the prior of ground truth target. Secondly, we explore compositional priors, utilizing several pretrained models to provide different estimation results, and then combining them in the data-to-data generation process to achieve a compositional priors-to-target imputation process.

For pure single-qubit inputs, a particular choice of the single-qubit unitary yields globally chaotic, strongly mixing dynamics that explores the entire Bloch sphere, providing a physical realization of ergodic behavior in a complex map. We extend the analysis to realistic, noisy preparation by considering mixed initial states and the induced nonlinear evolution inside the Bloch sphere. Numerical results show that the maximally mixed state is an attractor for mixed inputs, although many trajectories exhibit transient increases in purity before ultimately converging. To quantify robustness against noise, we introduce a practical notion of quasi-ergodicity: ensembles prepared in a small angular patch at fixed purity rapidly spread to cover all directions, while the purity gradually decreases toward its minimal value. By varying the final single-qubit gate, we identify a broad family of protocols that remain ergodic-like for pure states, supported by consistent diagnostics including the absence of attracting cycles, agreement of time and ensemble statistics, rapid spreading from localized regions, and exponential sensitivity to initial conditions. Away from the special globally mixing case, the mixed-state dynamics can change qualitatively: for most ergodic-like parameters, a finite subset of noisy inputs is driven toward purification rather than complete mixing, demonstrating the coexistence of statistical mixing and purification within a single iterated protocol."}

For stellar matter content, we adopt a widely used quark-matter model that approximates a realistic equation of state (EoS). By numerically integrating the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, we obtain interior solutions for static, spherically symmetric fluid spheres. The resulting sequences are compared directly with the predictions of General Relativity (GR). Our analysis focuses on three diagnostic indicators: (i) the mass-radius profiles under GR and three representative choices of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling; (ii) the stellar compactness factor, $C \\equiv M/R$; and (iii) the relation between stellar mass and central energy density. Recent observational studies suggest that the maximum masses inferred from the mass-radius relation may be larger than previously expected. To address this, we include a comparative set of constraints from multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational-wave event GW190814, as well as X-ray measurements from NICER for PSR~J0740+6620 and PSR~J0030+0451. These data provide stringent, astrophysically grounded tests of the viability of the models discussed here. Our results indicate that compact stars within 4DEGB gravity are systematically less compact and achieve moderately higher maximum masses compared to the GR case. This trend is consistent with recent theoretical analyses of compact stars in higher-curvature gravity theories and with constraints from multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these findings suggest that regularized Gauss-Bonnet corrections constitute a plausible extension of GR in the strong-field regime."}

We delve into unraveling the impact of NED and DM combined on the strong gravitational lensing (GL) and its related observables, such as the angular separation, relative magnification, and the angular position of the inner, closely packed bright ring.

An SPM layer implements a global linear transformation in $O(nL)$ time with $O(nL)$ parameters, where $L$ is typically constant or $log_2n$, and admits exact closed-form forward and backward computations. SPM is designed as a drop-in replacement for dense linear layers in feedforward networks, recurrent architectures, attention mechanisms, etc. We derive complete forward and backward expressions for two parameterizations: an orthogonal norm-preserving rotation-based variant and a fully general $2 \\times 2$ mixing variant. Beyond computational savings, the stagewise structure of SPM induces an explicit compositional inductive bias that constrains model capacity and improves generalization when aligned with task structure.

Through a phase-space analysis of signal propagation, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry: expansive dynamics amplify noise, whereas proper dissipative dynamics compress phase space that aligns with the network's spectral bias, compelling the abstraction of invariant features. This condition can be imposed externally via input encoding, or intrinsically through the network's own temporal dynamics. Both pathways require architectures capable of temporal integration and proper constraints to decode induced invariants, whereas static architectures fail to capitalize on temporal structure. Through comprehensive evaluations across supervised classification, unsupervised reconstruction, and zero-shot reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that a critical \"transition\" regime maximizes generalization capability. These findings establish dynamical constraints as a distinct class of inductive bias, suggesting that robust AI development requires not only scaling and removing limitations, but computationally mastering the temporal characteristics that naturally promote generalization."}

As a result, phenomenological investigations of the physical implications of these models have been made more difficult. We address this challenge by establishing a constructive framework which allows to formulate 4D covariant actions from the physical nature of the systems's degrees of freedom, which are dust and gravity, together with two guiding principles. We take advantage of the non-propagating nature of a relational dust clock and the suppression of gravitational waves in spherical symmetry. This structural ultralocality allows for a decomposition of the dynamics into independent LTB shells. We further impose spatial diffeomorphism invariance and a geometric guiding principle, where the latter ensures that a unique and static vacuum solution exists. These assumptions allow to strictly constrain the LTB shell Hamiltonian to a factorised form as well as the static vacuum metric function to a universal form. This constructive framework produces a fully 4D-covariant action that belongs to the class of generalised extended mimetic gravity models. This provides the necessary consistent basis for a perturbation theory in the context of quasi-normal modes or cosmological perturbations beyond the static sector in which quantum gravity effects are also included in linear and higher order perturbations. Furthermore, for this class of models our results resolve the long-standing `curvature polymerisation ambiguity' in loop quantum cosmology by unambiguously determining how flat space modifications are extended to non-flat geometries, thus unifying the description of black holes and cosmology in a single effective framework."}

This dissertation studies interactive machine learning, in which the learner actively influences how information is collected or which actions are taken, using past observations to guide future interactions. We develop new algorithmic principles and establish fundamental limits for interactive learning along three dimensions: active learning with noisy data and rich model classes, sequential decision making with large action spaces, and model selection under partial feedback. Our results include the first computationally efficient active learning algorithms achieving exponential label savings without low-noise assumptions; the first efficient, general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms whose guarantees are independent of the size of the action space; and the first tight characterizations of the fundamental cost of model selection in sequential decision making.

By assigning equal importance to all classes, regardless of their frequency, it promotes fairness and ensures that minority classes are not overlooked. However, directly minimizing the balanced classification loss is typically intractable, which makes the design of effective surrogate losses a central question. This paper introduces and studies two advanced surrogate loss families: Generalized Logit-Adjusted (GLA) loss functions and Generalized Class-Aware weighted (GCA) losses. GLA losses generalize Logit-Adjusted losses, which shift logits based on class priors, to the broader general cross-entropy loss family. GCA loss functions extend the standard class-weighted losses, which scale losses inversely by class frequency, by incorporating class-dependent confidence margins and extending them to the general cross-entropy family. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of consistency for both loss families. We show that GLA losses are Bayes-consistent, but only $H$-consistent for complete (i.e., unbounded) hypothesis sets. Moreover, their $H$-consistency bounds depend inversely on the minimum class probability, scaling at least as $1/\\mathsf p_{\\min}$. In contrast, GCA losses are $H$-consistent for any hypothesis set that is bounded or complete, with $H$-consistency bounds that scale more favorably as $1/\\sqrt{\\mathsf p_{\\min}}$, offering significantly stronger theoretical guarantees in imbalanced settings. We report the results of experiments demonstrating that, empirically, both the GCA losses with calibrated class-dependent confidence margins and GLA losses can greatly outperform straightforward class-weighted losses as well as the LA losses. GLA generally performs slightly better in common benchmarks, whereas GCA exhibits a slight edge in highly imbalanced settings."}

The Lie-algebraic criteria of controllability imply that such an array is not completely controllable, but satisfies the conditions for subspace controllability on any subspace with a fixed number of excitations. Therefore, a qubit array described by the model under consideration is state-to-state controllable for an arbitrary choice of initial and final states that have the same Hamming weight. This limited controllability is exploited here for the time-optimal dynamical generation of an $a$-excitation Dicke state $|D^{N}_{a}\\rangle$ ($a=1,2,\\ldots, N-1$) in a linear array with $N$ qubits starting from a generic Hamming-weight-$a$ product state. To dynamically generate the desired Dicke states -- including $W$ states $|W_{N}\\rangle$ as their special ($a=1$) case -- in the shortest possible time with a single local $Z$ control, we employ an optimal-control scheme based on the dressed Chopped RAndom Basis (dCRAB) algorithm. We optimize the target-state fidelity over the expansion coefficients of smoothly-varying control fields in a truncated random Fourier basis; this is done by combining Nelder-Mead-type local optimizations with the multistart-based clustering algorithm that facilitates searches for global extrema. In this manner, we obtain the optimal control fields for Dicke-state preparation in arrays with up to $N=9$ qubits. Based on our numerical results, we find that the shortest possible state-preparation times scale quadratically with $N$. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our control scheme against small control-field deviations from the optimal values."}

In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\\,M_\\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\\rm PBH}\\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints.

Additionally, most defense techniques are computationally expensive and often have unrealistic assumptions about the victim model that are not feasible in edge device implementations and do not apply to quantized models.

This work analyzes a system of two particles in harmonic traps interacting only through gravity, considering thermal and two-mode squeezed initial states. For thermal states, a maximum temperature is identified above which entanglement cannot be generated, and for fixed system parameters an optimal trap frequency that maximizes the logarithmic negativity is found. Squeezing the initial state does not further enhance the entanglement generation, but increases the temperature range over which it can be observed. Extending the analysis to general Gaussian states, an upper bound on the achievable entanglement is derived and shown to be saturated, for example, by ground and squeezed states. The results show that the amount of entanglement generated in this setup is extremely small, highlighting the experimental challenges of observing gravitationally induced quantum effects."}

This shift creates an autonomy paradox: as GenAI systems are granted greater operational autonomy, they should, by design, embody more formal structure, more explicit constraints, and stronger tail-risk discipline. We argue stochastic generative models can be fragile in operational domains unless paired with mechanisms that provide verifiable feasibility, robustness to distribution shift, and stress testing under high-consequence scenarios. To address this challenge, we develop a conceptual framework for assured autonomy grounded in operations research (OR), built on two complementary approaches. First, flow-based generative models frame generation as deterministic transport characterized by an ordinary differential equation, enabling auditability, constraint-aware generation, and connections to optimal transport, robust optimization, and sequential decision control. Second, operational safety is formulated through an adversarial robustness lens: decision rules are evaluated against worst-case perturbations within uncertainty or ambiguity sets, making unmodeled risks part of the design. This framework clarifies how increasing autonomy shifts OR's role from solver to guardrail to system architect, with responsibility for control logic, incentive protocols, monitoring regimes, and safety boundaries. These elements define a research agenda for assured autonomy in safety-critical, reliability-sensitive operational domains."}

Within this approach, we derive a generalized Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty inequality which is valid across all spectral regimes. As an application, we analyze a two level model with parity-time reversal symmetry and show that, while the uncertainty measure exhibits oscillatory behavior in the unbroken phase, it evolves toward a minimum-uncertainty steady state in the broken symmetry phase and at exceptional points.

We begin by noting that classical evaluation metrics such as stress, rank-based neighborhood criteria, or Local Procrustes quantify distortions in distances or in local geometries, but do not directly assess how much information is preserved when projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. To address this limitation, we introduce the Entropy Rank Preservation Measure (ERPM), a local metric based on the Shannon entropy of the singular-value spectrum of neighborhood matrices and on the stable rank, which quantifies changes in uncertainty between the original representation and its reduced projection, providing neighborhood-level indicators and a global summary statistic. To validate the results of the metric, we compare its outcomes with the Mean Relative Rank Error (MRRE), which is distance-based, and with Local Procrustes, which is based on geometric properties, using a financial time series and a manifold commonly studied in the literature. We observe that distance-based criteria exhibit very low correlation with geometric and spectral measures, while ERPM and Local Procrustes show strong average correlation but display significant discrepancies in local regimes, leading to the conclusion that ERPM complements existing metrics by identifying neighborhoods with severe information loss, thereby enabling a more comprehensive assessment of embeddings, particularly in information-sensitive applications such as the construction of early-warning indicators."}

Accurate modeling of these devices is essential for predicting performance, improving design, and optimizing control. Many modeling approaches currently rely on lumped circuit approximations or other simplified treatments that can be limited in resolving the interplay between the qubit dynamics and the electromagnetic circuitry, leading to significant experimental deviations from numerical predictions at times. To address many of these limitations, methods that self-consistently solve the Schrödinger equation for qubit dynamics with the classical Maxwell's equations have been developed and shown to accurately predict a wide range of effects related to superconducting qubit control and readout. Despite these successes, these methods have not been able to consider multi-qubit effects that give rise to qubit-qubit entanglement. Here, we address this by rigorously deriving how multi-qubit coupling effects between transmon qubits can be embedded into Maxwell-Schrödinger methods. To support this, we build on earlier first-principles derivations of Maxwell-Schrödinger methods for the specific case of two transmon qubits coupled together through a common electromagnetic system in the dispersive regime. To aid in validating aspects of the Maxwell-Schrödinger framework, we also provide a new interpretation of Maxwell-Schrödinger methods as an efficient simulation strategy to capture the class of non-Markovian open quantum system dynamics. Our results demonstrate that these effects can give rise to strong classical crosstalk that can significantly alter multi-qubit dynamics, which we demonstrate for the cross-resonance gate. These classical crosstalk effects have been noted in cross-resonance experiments, but previous quantum theory and device analysis could not explain their origin."}

Recent strides in electrocardiogram self-supervised learning (eSSL) have brightened prospects for enhancing representation learning without relying on high-quality annotations. Yet earlier eSSL methods suffer a key limitation: they focus on consistent patterns across leads and beats, overlooking the inherent differences in heartbeats rooted in cardiac conduction processes, while subtle but significant variations carry unique physiological signatures. Moreover, representation learning for ECG analysis should align with ECG diagnostic guidelines, which progress from individual heartbeats to single leads and ultimately to lead combinations. This sequential logic, however, is often neglected when applying pre-trained models to downstream tasks. To address these gaps, we propose CLEAR-HUG, a two-stage framework designed to capture subtle variations in cardiac conduction across leads while adhering to ECG diagnostic guidelines. In the first stage, we introduce an eSSL model termed Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor (CLEAR), which captures both specific variations and general commonalities across heartbeats. Treating each heartbeat as a distinct entity, CLEAR employs a simple yet effective sparse attention mechanism to reconstruct signals without interference from other heartbeats. In the second stage, we implement a Hierarchical lead-Unified Group head (HUG) for disease diagnosis, mirroring clinical workflow. Experimental results across six tasks show a 6.84% improvement, validating the effectiveness of CLEAR-HUG. This highlights its ability to enhance representations of cardiac conduction and align patterns with expert diagnostic guidelines."}

We analyze the effect of the Coulomb coupling on three distinct synchronization regimes, i.e., complete quantum synchronization, $φ$-synchronization, and quantum phase synchronization. Our results show that while the Coulomb interaction plays a pivotal role in significantly enhancing quantum phase synchronization by facilitating energy exchange and phase coherence, it has little impact on complete and $φ$-synchronization. This indicates that amplitude and frequency locking are primarily determined by the optical driving, whereas phase alignment depends critically on inter-resonator coupling. We also demonstrate that the oscillations of the two optical cavities, which are indirectly coupled via the mechanical resonators, can become aligned over time, resulting in classical synchronization. These findings provide a robust mechanism for controlling collective quantum dynamics and offer a foundation for applications in quantum communication, precision sensing, and the development of synchronized quantum networks."}

However, existing GRL methods often rely on surrogate contrastive objectives or mutual information maximization, which typically demand complex architectures, negative sampling strategies, and sensitive hyperparameter tuning. These design choices may induce over-smoothing, over-squashing, and training instability. In this work, we propose HyperGRL, a unified framework for hyperspherical graph representation learning via adaptive neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. HyperGRL embeds nodes on a unit hypersphere through two adversarially coupled objectives: neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. The alignment objective uses the mean representation of each node's local neighborhood to construct semantically grounded, stable targets that capture shared structural and feature patterns. The uniformity objective formulates dispersion via an L2-based hyperspherical regularization, encouraging globally uniform embedding distributions while preserving discriminative information. To further stabilize training, we introduce an entropy-guided adaptive balancing mechanism that dynamically regulates the interplay between alignment and uniformity without requiring manual tuning. Extensive experiments on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction demonstrate that HyperGRL delivers superior representation quality and generalization across diverse graph structures, achieving average improvements of 1.49%, 0.86%, and 0.74% over the strongest existing methods, respectively. These findings highlight the effectiveness of geometrically grounded, sampling-free contrastive objectives for graph representation learning."}

This paper develops this perspective for circuit QED dispersive readout through a first-principles derivation starting from the circuit Lagrangian. The transmon qubit terminating a transmission line resonator provides a frequency-dependent boundary condition whose pole structure encodes the qubit's transition frequencies; different qubit states yield different resonator frequencies. Two approximations, linear response and a pole-dominated expansion valid near resonance, reduce the boundary function to a rational form in the Sturm-Liouville eigenparameter. The extended Hilbert space of the Fulton-Walter spectral theory then provides a framework for the dressed-mode eigenvalue problem conditional on the qubit state. The dispersive shift and vacuum Rabi splitting emerge from the transcendental eigenvalue equation, with the residues determined by matching to the splitting: $δ_{ge} = 2Lg^2ω_q^2/v^4$, where $g$ is the vacuum Rabi coupling. A level repulsion theorem guarantees that no dressed mode frequency coincides with a transmon transition. For two qubits with matched dispersive shifts, odd-parity states become frequency-degenerate; true parity-only measurement requires engineered suppression of linear dispersive terms."}

The reasons behind this divergence remain unclear, as prior studies have largely relied on coarse accuracy metrics. We address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark that decomposes reasoning into atomic core skills such as calculation, fact retrieval, simulation, enumeration, and diagnostic, providing a concrete framework for addressing the fundamental question of what constitutes reasoning in LLMs. By isolating and measuring these core skills, the benchmark offers a more granular view of how specific cognitive abilities emerge, transfer, and sometimes collapse during post-training. Combined with analyses of low-level statistical patterns such as distributional divergence and parameter statistics, it enables a fine-grained study of how generalization evolves under SFT and RL across mathematical, scientific reasoning, and non-reasoning tasks. Our meta-probing framework tracks model behavior at different training stages and reveals that RL-tuned models maintain more stable behavioral profiles and resist collapse in reasoning skills, whereas SFT models exhibit sharper drift and overfit to surface patterns. This work provides new insights into the nature of reasoning in LLMs and points toward principles for designing training strategies that foster broad, robust generalization."}

The model features direction-dependent quadratic couplings that interpolate between uniaxial and biaxial regimes and can be interpreted as an asymmetric quantum rotor. Using semiclassical dynamics, Majorana representations, and Husimi-Q distributions, we analyze the structure and metrological properties of the resulting states. The three-axis framework reproduces the known N^(-2/3) scaling of one-axis twisting and the Heisenberg-limited N^(-1) scaling of two-axis twisting, while allowing additional tunability and enhanced entanglement generation in low-spin systems. We further show that tuning the anisotropy parameters induces ground-state and excited-state quantum phase transitions, including a second-order transition associated with level clustering and critical dynamics.

However, existing designs mostly focused on minimizing the communication time, leaving open the minimization of per-node energy consumption that is critical for energy-constrained devices. This work addresses this gap through a theoretically-justified solution for mixing matrix design that aims at minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption until convergence, while taking into account the broadcast nature of wireless communications. Based on a novel convergence theorem that allows arbitrarily time-varying mixing matrices, we propose a multi-phase design framework that activates time-varying communication topologies under optimized budgets to trade off the per-iteration energy consumption and the convergence rate while balancing the energy consumption across nodes. Our evaluations based on real data have validated the efficacy of the proposed solution in combining the low energy consumption of sparse mixing matrices and the fast convergence of dense mixing matrices."}

Language models typically rely on an autoregressive factorization over tokens. In contrast, our prior work proposed shifting sequential structure to the latent space through a causal Gaussian process, while using a non-autoregressive decoder. Here, we conduct a systematic ablation study of the role played by latent autoregression. We compare (i) a full GP-VAE model with autoregressive latent dynamics, (ii) a non-autoregressive ablation in which latent variables are independent, and (iii) a standard token-level autoregressive Transformer. Our results show that, within the considered regime (medium-scale corpora and short training contexts), latent autoregression induces latent trajectories that are significantly more compatible with the Gaussian-process prior and exhibit greater long-horizon stability. In contrast, removing autoregression leads to degraded latent structure and unstable long-range behavior. These findings highlight the role of latent autoregression as an effective mechanism for organizing long-range structure, while remaining complementary to token-level autoregressive modeling.

The nonlinear response arises from the coupling of the mechanical mode to an ensemble of microscopic two-level system defects driven out of equilibrium by a microwave drive. In contrast to the conventional Duffing oscillator, the observed nonlinearity exhibits a mixed reactive-dissipative character. Notably, the reactive effect can manifest as either a softening or hardening of the mechanical resonance, depending on the ratio of thermal to phonon energy. By combining the standard TLS theory with a thermal conductance model, the measured power-dependent response is quantitatively reproduced and readout-enhanced relaxation damping from off-resonant TLSs is identified as the primary mechanism limiting mechanical coherence. Within this framework, we delineate the conditions under which similar systems will realize this nonlinearity."}

We primarily focus on GPTQ as the quantization method. Our main method is OptRot, which reduces weight outliers simply by minimizing the element-wise fourth power of the rotated weights. We show that OptRot outperforms both Hadamard rotations and more expensive, data-dependent methods like SpinQuant and OSTQuant for weight quantization. It also improves activation quantization in the W4A8 setting. We also propose a data-dependent method, OptRot$^{+}$, that further improves performance by incorporating information on the activation covariance.

Project: https://tinnerhrhe.github.io/gardo_project", "summary": "Fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for enhancing text-to-image alignment. However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse proxy rewards and hold-out unseen metrics consistently show that GARDO mitigates reward hacking and enhances generation diversity without sacrificing sample efficiency or exploration, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness."}

An exponentially scaling DLA dimension is associated with the presence of so-called barren plateaus (BP) in the optimization landscape, which renders training intractable. In this work, we investigate the DLA of QAOA applied to the canonical MaxCut, for both weighted and unweighted graphs. For weighted graphs, we show that when the weights are drawn from a continuous distribution, the DLA dimension grows as $Θ(4^n)$ almost surely for all connected graphs except paths and cycles. In the more common unweighted setting, we show that asymptotically all but an exponentially vanishing fraction of graphs have $Θ(4^n)$ large DLA dimension. The entire simple Lie algebra decomposition of the corresponding DLAs is also identified, from which we prove that the variance of the loss function is $O(1/2^n)$, implying that QAOA on these weighted and unweighted graphs all suffers from BP. Moreover, we give explicit constructions for families of graphs whose DLAs have exponential dimension, including cases whose MaxCut is in $\\mathsf P$. Our proof of the unweighted case is based on a number of splitting lemmas and DLA-freeness conditions that allow one to convert prohibitively complicated Lie algebraic problems into amenable graph theoretic problems. These form the basis for a new algorithm that computes such DLAs orders of magnitude faster than previous methods, reducing runtimes from days to seconds on standard hardware. We apply this algorithm to MQLib, a classical MaxCut benchmark suite covering over 3,500 instances with up to 53,130 vertices, and find that, ignoring edge weights, at least 75% of the instances possess a DLA of dimension at least $2^{128}$."}

Distinct from approaches that target relaxed notions of conditional coverage, we directly minimize the mean squared error of conditional coverage by refining the quantile regression components that underpin many conformal methods. Leveraging a Taylor expansion, we derive a sharp surrogate objective for quantile regression: a density-weighted pinball loss, where the weights are given by the conditional density of the conformity score evaluated at the true quantile. We propose a three-headed quantile network that estimates these weights via finite differences using auxiliary quantile levels at \\(1-α\\pm δ\\), subsequently fine-tuning the central quantile by optimizing the weighted loss. We provide a theoretical analysis with exact non-asymptotic guarantees characterizing the resulting excess risk.

We analyse the statistical structure of comparative evaluation in these settings and show that standard independent evaluation designs fail to exploit shared sources of randomness across alternatives. We formalise a paired seed evaluation design in which competing systems are evaluated under identical random seeds, inducing matched realisations of stochastic components and strict variance reduction whenever outcomes are positively correlated at the seed level. This yields tighter confidence intervals, higher statistical power, and effective sample size gains at fixed computational budgets. Empirically, seed-level correlations are typically large and positive, producing order-of-magnitude efficiency gains. Paired seed evaluation is weakly dominant in practice, improving statistical reliability when correlation is present and reducing to independent evaluation without loss of validity when it is not."}

In contrast, three-dimensional lattices are found to be fundamentally non-radiative due to the inhibition of spontaneous emission, with decay only at discrete Bragg resonances.

However, the cost of uncertainty sampling, the high-dimensional phase space, and multiscale stiffness pose severe challenges to both computational efficiency and error control in traditional numerical methods. These aspects are further emphasized in presence of collisions where the high-dimensional nonlocal collision integrations and conservation properties pose severe constraints. To overcome this, we present a variance-reduced Monte Carlo framework for UQ in the Vlasov--Poisson--Landau (VPL) system, in which neural network surrogates replace the multiple costly evaluations of the Landau collision term. The method couples a high-fidelity, asymptotic-preserving VPL solver with inexpensive, strongly correlated surrogates based on the Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck (VPFP) and Euler--Poisson (EP) equations. For the surrogate models, we introduce a generalization of the separable physics-informed neural network (SPINN), developing a class of tensor neural networks based on an anisotropic micro-macro decomposition, to reduce velocity-moment costs, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. To further increase correlation with VPL, we calibrate the VPFP model and design an asymptotic-preserving SPINN whose small- and large-Knudsen limits recover the EP and VP systems, respectively. Numerical experiments show substantial variance reduction over standard Monte Carlo, accurate statistics with far fewer high-fidelity samples, and lower wall-clock time, while maintaining robustness to stochastic dimension."}

This research introduces and evaluates four novel machine learning algorithms designed for predicting the onset of sepsis on wearable devices by analyzing heart rate data. The architecture of these models was refined through a genetic algorithm, optimizing for performance, computational complexity, and memory requirements. Performance metrics were subsequently extracted for each model to evaluate their feasibility for implementation on wearable devices capable of accurate heart rate monitoring.

Current research is shifting from single-signal to multi-modal collaborative approaches. However, existing multi-modal methods mostly employ fixed or empirical weights, assuming equal reliability across modalities at any given moment. Indeed, the importance of different modalities fluctuates dramatically with UAV motion scenarios, and static weighting amplifies the negative impact of degraded modalities. Furthermore, modal mismatch and weak alignment further undermine cross-scenario generalization. To this end, we propose a reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme applied to a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction framework, named SaM2B. Specifically, SaM2B leverages lightweight cues such as environmental visual, flight posture, and geospatial data to adaptively allocate contributions across modalities at different time points through reliability-aware dynamic weight updates. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal contrastive learning, we align the \"multi-source representation beam semantics\" associated with specific beam information to a shared semantic space, thereby enhancing discriminative power and robustness under modal noise and distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world low-altitude UAV datasets show that SaM2B achieves more satisfactory results than baseline methods."}

Inspired by quantum superposition in modeling uncertainty, this paper proposes a Quantum Inference Model for Unsupervised Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (Q-VWSD). It encodes multiple glosses of the target word into a superposition state to mitigate semantic biases. Then, the quantum circuit is executed, and the results are observed. By formalizing our method, we find that Q-VWSD is a quantum generalization of the method based on classical probability. Building on this, we further designed a heuristic version of Q-VWSD that can run more efficiently on classical computing.

We develop a semiparametric framework for debiased inverse reinforcement learning that yields statistically efficient inference for a broad class of reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. We show that the log-behavior policy acts as a pseudo-reward that point-identifies policy value differences and, under a simple normalization, the reward itself.

Theoretically, we establish estimation and prediction error bounds for the L1-regularized Pconf estimator, proving it achieves near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates under Restricted Strong Convexity condition. To solve the resulting composite objective, we develop an efficient proximal gradient algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve predictive performance and variable selection accuracy comparable to fully supervised approaches, effectively bridging the gap between weak supervision and high-dimensional statistics."}

A standard method for this is interleaved benchmarking, a technique which estimates the error on an interleaved target gate by comparing cumulative error rates of randomized sequences implemented with the interleaved gate and without it. In this work, we show both numerically and experimentally that the standard approach of interleaved randomized benchmarking (IRB), which uses the multi-qubit Clifford group for randomization, can produce highly inaccurate and even physically impossible estimates for the error on the interleaved gate in the presence of coherent errors. Fortunately we also show that interleaved benchmarking performed with cycle benchmarking, which randomizes with single qubit Pauli gates, provides dramatically reduced systematic uncertainty relative to standard IRB, and further provides as host of additional benefits including data reusability. We support our conclusions with a theoretical framework for bounding systematic errors, extensive numerical results comparing a range of interleaved protocols under fixed resource costs, and experimental demonstrations on three quantum computing platforms."}

While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments."}

This allows flexible control over the number of binary variables and adapts well to hardware constraints. We prove convergence properties, introduce a step size adaptation scheme, and validate the method on linear regression.

Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models."}

Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology.

Rethinking Proxy-Model Practice", "comment": null, "summary": "Data teams at frontier AI companies routinely train small proxy models to make critical decisions about pretraining data recipes for full-scale training runs. However, the community has a limited understanding of whether and when conclusions drawn from small-scale experiments reliably transfer to full-scale model training. In this work, we uncover a subtle yet critical issue in the standard experimental protocol for data recipe assessment: the use of identical small-scale model training configurations across all data recipes in the name of \"fair\" comparison. We show that the experiment conclusions about data quality can flip with even minor adjustments to training hyperparameters, as the optimal training configuration is inherently data-dependent. Moreover, this fixed-configuration protocol diverges from full-scale model development pipelines, where hyperparameter optimization is a standard step. Consequently, we posit that the objective of data recipe assessment should be to identify the recipe that yields the best performance under data-specific tuning. To mitigate the high cost of hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a simple patch to the evaluation protocol: using reduced learning rates for proxy model training. We show that this approach yields relative performance that strongly correlates with that of fully tuned large-scale LLM pretraining runs. Theoretically, we prove that for random-feature models, this approach preserves the ordering of datasets according to their optimal achievable loss. Empirically, we validate this approach across 23 data recipes covering four critical dimensions of data curation, demonstrating dramatic improvements in the reliability of small-scale experiments."}

In particular, the potential to build generative models on classically hard distributions would immediately preclude classical simulability, due to theoretical separations. In this work, we study quantum generative models from the perspective of output distributions, showing that models that anticoncentrate are not trainable on average, including those exhibiting quantum advantage. In contrast, models outputting data from sparse distributions can be trained. We consider special cases to enhance trainability, and observe that this opens the path for classical algorithms for surrogate sampling. This observed trade-off is linked to verification of quantum processes. We conclude that quantum advantage can still be found in generative models, although its source must be distinct from anticoncentration."}

However, BPTT requires storing the history of all states in the network and then replaying them sequentially backwards in time. This computation appears extremely implausible for the brain to implement. Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) proposes an mathematically equivalent alternative where gradient information is propagated forwards in time locally alongside the regular forward pass, however it has significantly greater computational complexity than BPTT which renders it impractical for large networks. E-prop proposes an approximation of RTRL which reduces its complexity to the level of BPTT while maintaining a purely online forward update which can be implemented by an eligibility trace at each synapse. However, works on RTRL and E-prop ubiquitously investigate learning in a single layer with recurrent dynamics. However, learning in the brain spans multiple layers and consists of both hierarchal dynamics in depth as well as time. In this mathematical note, we extend the E-prop framework to handle arbitrarily deep networks, deriving a novel recursion relationship across depth which extends the eligibility traces of E-prop to deeper layers. Our results thus demonstrate an online learning algorithm can perform accurate credit assignment across both time and depth simultaneously, allowing the training of deep recurrent networks without backpropagation through time."}

Although the deformation is invisible on a single qubit, it resurfaces in the two-qubit sector through the non-cocommutative coproduct, yielding a family of intrinsically nonlocal unitaries. We compute their operator entanglement in closed form and show that, for Haar-uniform product inputs, their entangling power is fully determined by the latter. This provides a concrete mechanism by which non-commutative symmetries enforce a baseline of entanglement at the algebraic level, with implications for information dynamics in quantum-spacetime settings and quantum information processing."}

We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness.

It requires a nuanced reasoning over visual content, contextual cues, and subjective humor. To bridge this gap between visual perception and humorous punchline creation, we propose HUMOR}, a novel framework that guides VLMs through hierarchical reasoning and aligns them with group-wise human preferences. First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity. We further analyze that this multi-path exploration with anchoring maintains a high expected humor quality, under the practical condition that high-quality paths retain significant probability mass. Second, to capture subjective humor, we train a pairwise reward model that operates within groups of memes sharing the same template. Following established theory, this approach ensures a consistent and robust proxy for human preference, even with subjective and noisy labels. The reward model then enables a group-wise reinforcement learning optimization, guaranteeing providing a theoretical guarantee for monotonic improvement within the trust region. Extensive experiments show that HUMOR empowers various VLMs with superior reasoning diversity, more reliable preference alignment, and higher overall meme quality. Beyond memes, our work presents a general training paradigm for open-ended, human-aligned multimodal generation, where success is guided by comparative judgment within coherent output group."}

Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment.

This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity.

We developed a novel computational infrastructure to address the data integration challenge, reducing processing time from a projected over 100 days to 3.2 hours through byte-offset indexing architecture, a 740-fold improvement. Our comprehensive analysis revealed critical insights into the multivariate nature of lipophilicity: while molecular weight exhibited weak bivariate correlation with logP, SHAP analysis on ensemble models identified it as the single most important predictor globally. We systematically evaluated multiple modeling approaches, discovering that linear models suffered from inherent heteroskedasticity that classical remediation strategies, including weighted least squares and Box-Cox transformation, failed to address. Tree-based ensemble methods, including Random Forest and XGBoost, proved inherently robust to this violation, achieving an R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units on the test set. Furthermore, a stratified modeling strategy, employing specialized models for drug-like molecules (91 percent of dataset) and extreme cases (nine percent), achieved optimal performance: an RMSE of 0.838 for the drug-like subset and an R-squared of 0.767 for extreme molecules, the highest of all evaluated approaches. These findings provide actionable guidance for molecular design, establish robust baselines for lipophilicity prediction using only 2D descriptors, and demonstrate that well-curated, descriptor-based ensemble models remain competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures."}

The effects of decoherence are then examined under two local noise mechanisms, namely dephasing and phase-flip channels, acting on the qubit and qutrit subsystems in both symmetric and asymmetric configurations. Quantum correlations are quantified using negativity to capture entanglement and quantum discord based on linear entropy to characterize more general nonclassical correlations. Our results show that both thermal fluctuations and phase noise lead to a monotonic degradation of quantum correlations, with increasing temperature accelerating coherence loss and inducing entanglement sudden death at finite temperatures. While negativity vanishes abruptly under sufficiently strong noise, quantum discord persists beyond the entanglement threshold, revealing residual quantum correlations in mixed states. We further demonstrate that asymmetric noise configurations significantly enhance the robustness of both entanglement and discord by partially shielding coherence in the less affected subsystem. A comparative analysis reveals that phase-flip noise is more destructive than pure dephasing, leading to faster suppression of quantum correlations."}

We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD. These results highlight practical backdoor risks in heterogeneous graph learning and motivate the development of stronger defenses."}

ModEn-Hub centralizes entanglement sources and shared quantum memory to deliver on-demand, high-fidelity Bell pairs across heterogeneous QPUs, while the control plane schedules teleportation-based non-local gates, launches parallel entanglement attempts, and maintains a small ebit cache. To quantify benefits, we implement a lightweight, reproducible Monte Carlo study under realistic loss and tight round budgets, comparing a naive sequential baseline to an orchestrated policy with logarithmically scaled parallelism and opportunistic caching. Across 1-128 QPUs and 2,500 trials per point, ModEn-Hub-style orchestration sustains about 90% teleportation success while the baseline degrades toward about 30%, at the cost of higher average entanglement attempts (about 10-12 versus about 3).

The user mobility, either natural or induced, enables clients to act as relays or bridges, thus enhancing information flow in sparse networks; however, its impact on DFL has been largely overlooked despite its potential. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of mobility in improving DFL performance. We first establish the convergence of DFL in sparse networks under user mobility and theoretically demonstrate that even random movement of a fraction of users can significantly boost performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a DFL framework that utilizes mobile users with induced mobility patterns, allowing them to exploit the knowledge of data distribution to determine their trajectories to enhance information propagation through the network. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm our theoretical findings, validate the superiority of our approach over baselines, and provide a comprehensive analysis of how various network parameters influence DFL performance in mobile networks."}

In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks."}

We test this formalism with two- and three-particle quantum mechanical systems, with both long range Coulomb-like interactions between the particles and external fields acting separately on the particles, in various spatial dimensionality. We extract accurate estimations of the ground state energy of these systems using the late-time behaviour of the propagator, validating our approach with numerically exact solutions obtained via straightforward diagonalisation of the Hamiltonian.

The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.\n  We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees. Synthetic experiments that vary the strength and dimensionality of pervasive confounding demonstrate consistent improvements in directed edge recovery over applying correlated-noise DAG learning directly to the confounded data."}

However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.\n  To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set. This semi-overlapping arm property defines a novel multi-bandit cost/reward structure utilized in BandiK."}

These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\\partial L / \\partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry. Optimization and inference are the same process."}

In this review, we describe the recent advances in the study of L-PT phase transitions. First, we define PT symmetry in three distinct contexts: non-Hermitian systems, nonlinear dynamical systems, and Markovian open quantum systems, highlighting the interconnections between these frameworks. Second, we develop mean-field theories of L-PT phase transitions for collective-spin systems and for bipartite bosonic systems with particle-number conservation. Within these classes of models, we show that L-PT symmetry can induce a breaking of continuous time-translation symmetry down to a discrete one, leading to persistent periodic dynamics. We further demonstrate that the L-PT phase transition point is typically \\textit{a critical exceptional point}, where multiple collective excitation modes with zero excitation spectrum coalesce. These findings establish an explicit connection to continuous-time crystals and non-reciprocal phase transitions. Third, going beyond the mean-field theory, we analyze statistical and quantum properties, such as purity and quantum entanglement indicators of time-independent steady states for several specific models with the L-PT symmetry.

Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) addresses this by framing non-transitive preferences as a two-player zero-sum game, where alignment reduces to finding the Nash equilibrium (NE). However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results.

Although ADAPT-VQE avoids many of the shortcomings of other VQEs, it is sometimes hindered by a phenomenon known as gradient troughs. This refers to a non-monotonic convergence of the gradients, which may become very small even though the minimum energy has not been reached. This results in difficulties finding the right operators to add to the ansatz, due to the limited number of shots and statistical uncertainties, leading to stagnation in the circuit structure optimization. In this paper, we propose ways to detect and mitigate this phenomenon. Leveraging the non-commutative algebra of the ansatz, we develop heuristics for determining where to insert new operators into the circuit. We find that gradient troughs are more likely to arise when the same locations are used repeatedly for new operator insertions. Our novel protocols, which add new operators in different ansatz positions, allow us to escape gradient troughs and thereby lower the measurement cost of the algorithm. This approach achieves an effective balance between cost and efficiency, leading to faster convergence without compromising the low circuit depth and gate count of ADAPT-VQE."}

In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \\textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \\textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods."}

Our framework allows any tomographic data - including archival datasets -- to be reinterpreted in terms of fundamental nonlocality tests. We introduce a generic, constructive method to generate tailored Bell inequalities and showcase their applicability to certify the non-locality of states in realistic experimental scenarios. Recognizing the stabilizer nature of the considered operators, we analyze our inequalities in the context of witnessing quantum magic - a crucial resource for quantum computing. Our approach requires Pauli measurements only and tests the quantum magic solely through the resources present in the state. Our results establish a universal standard that unifies state tomography with nonlocality certification and its application to quantum magic witnessing, thereby streamlining both fundamental studies and practical applications."}

We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training. We compare the statistical and computational approaches to transfer, which indicates considerably higher compute costs for the previous but better power and broader applicability.

Building on this idea, we develop a theoretical framework describing a non-inertial observer equipped with a detector undergoing non-uniform, time-dependent acceleration. We show that, in a non-uniformly accelerated Rindler spacetime, the particle distribution perceived in the Minkowski vacuum acquires a time-dependent modification of the standard Unruh spectrum.

At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy. This design allows the model to jointly capture global structure and local dynamics of the signal, enabling accurate forecasting. Experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for forecasting. Overall, these results demonstrate that our hierarchical approach provides a lightweight and flexible framework for forecasting multivariate time series.

In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation.

Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods.

Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs."}

To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy."}

Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.\n  B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines."}

In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and data to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible."}

N. DeSouza"], "title": "Quantum Error Mitigation with Attention Graph Transformers for Burgers Equation Solvers on NISQ Hardware", "comment": null, "summary": "We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework augmented with learned error mitigation for solving the viscous Burgers equation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone. We discuss extensions of this approach to higher-dimensional Burgers systems and more general quantum partial differential equation solvers, highlighting learned error mitigation as a promising complement to physics-based noise reduction techniques on NISQ devices."}

However, the lack of unified software interface across tensor-computing frameworks severely limits the portability of TN applications, coupling algorithmic development to specific hardware and software back ends. To address this challenge, we introduce the Tensor Computing Interface (TCI) -- an application-oriented, lightweight application programming interface designed to enable framework-independent, high-performance TN applications. TCI provides a well-defined type system that abstracts tensor objects together with a minimal yet expressive set of core functions covering essential tensor manipulations and tensor linear-algebra operations. Through numerical demonstrations on representative tensor-network applications, we show that codes written against TCI can be migrated seamlessly across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms while achieving performance comparable to native framework implementations. We further release an open-source implementation of TCI based on \\textit{Cytnx}, demonstrating its practicality and ease of integration with existing tensor-computing frameworks."}

Here we address this challenge by combining sparse Boltzmann machine architectures with probabilistic computing hardware. We implement a probabilistic computer on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and use it as a fast sampler for energy-based neural quantum states. For the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality, we obtain accurate ground-state energies for lattices up to 80 $\\times$ 80 (6400 spins) using a custom multi-FPGA cluster. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines, replacing intractable marginalization with conditional sampling over auxiliary layers. This enables the training of sparse deep models and improves parameter efficiency relative to shallow networks. Using this algorithm, we train deep Boltzmann machines for a system with 35 $\\times$ 35 (1225 spins). Together, these results demonstrate that probabilistic hardware can overcome the sampling bottleneck in variational simulation of quantum many-body systems, opening a path to larger system sizes and deeper variational architectures."}

This has fueled the use of quantum computers for generative modeling to create samples following the probability distribution underlying a given dataset. In particular, the potential to build generative models on classically hard distributions would immediately preclude classical simulability, due to theoretical separations. In this work, we study quantum generative models from the perspective of output distributions, showing that models that anticoncentrate are not trainable on average, including those exhibiting quantum advantage. In contrast, models outputting data from sparse distributions can be trained. We consider special cases to enhance trainability, and observe that this opens the path for classical algorithms for surrogate sampling. This observed trade-off is linked to verification of quantum processes. We conclude that quantum advantage can still be found in generative models, although its source must be distinct from anticoncentration."}
