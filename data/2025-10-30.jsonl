We examine whether such neurons\nare important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they\nare located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture\nselectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by\ndifferent identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural\ngroups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately\nharms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having\nminimal effects on others.

Although\nthese definitions coincide in the infinite-separation limit, they could differ\nby finite-separation corrections that matter for precision modeling. Working\nentirely in harmonic gauge, we perform asymptotic matching between each\ncompanion's inner zone metric -- obtained from black hole perturbation theory\n-- and the PN two-body metric, and construct the coordinate transformation that\npreserves the gauge in the strong field region. We solve perturbatively for the\napparent horizon (AH) on a group of harmonic inertial time slice and compute\nits quasi-local areal mass from the horizon geometry.

The\npersistent challenge lies in the fundamental trade-off between speed and\naccuracy: efforts to improve the decoder's accuracy often lead to unacceptable\nincreases in decoding time and hardware complexity, while attempts to\naccelerate decoding result in a significant degradation in logical error rate.\nTo overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework, decoder switching,\nwhich balances these competing demands by combining a faster, soft-output\ndecoder (\"weak decoder\") with a slower, high-accuracy decoder (\"strong\ndecoder\"). In usual rounds, the weak decoder processes error syndromes and\nsimultaneously evaluates its reliability via soft information. Only when\nencountering a decoding window with low reliability do we switch to the strong\ndecoder to achieve more accurate decoding. Numerical simulations suggest that\nthis framework can achieve accuracy comparable to, or even surpassing, that of\nthe strong decoder, while maintaining an average decoding time on par with the\nweak decoder.

Despite its theoretical\nappeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of\nautonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal\noption termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that\nintegrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)\nmodule into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of\nstate trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained\nusing heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent\nshifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred\nchange-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory\nsignals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain\nintra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce\nfunctional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over\nCPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the\nstandard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our\nframework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments\nare mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to\nautonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful\nskills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that\nCPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,\nand significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that\nintegrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more\ninterpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex\nenvironments."}

However, for arbitrary qudit-based hardware platform the issue is that\na generic qudit operation has to be decomposed into the sequence of native\noperations $-$ pulses that are adjusted to the transitions between two levels\nin a qudit. Typically, not all levels in a qudit are simply connected to each\nother due to specific selection rules. Moreover, the number of pulses plays a\nsignificant role, since each pulse takes a certain execution time and may\nintroduce error. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient algorithm to\ndecompose single-qudit operations into the sequence of pulses that are allowed\nby qudit selection rules. Using the developed algorithm, the number of pulses\nis at most $d(d{-}1)/2$ for an arbitrary single-qudit operation. For specific\noperations the algorithm could produce even fewer pulses.

In some cases, source data\nmay exist in multiple formats, and therefore the source data must be\ninvestigated and properly engineered for a Machine Learning model or graph\ndatabase. Overhead and lack of scalability with existing workflows limit\nintegration within a larger processing pipeline such as Apache Airflow, driving\nthe need for a robust, extensible, and lightweight tool to preprocess arbitrary\ndatasets that scales with data type and size. To address this, we present\nMachine Learning Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis, MLPrE, in which\nSparkDataFrames were utilized to hold data during processing and ensure\nscalability. A generalizable JSON input file format was utilized to describe\nstepwise changes to that DataFrame. Stages were implemented for input and\noutput, filtering, basic statistics, feature engineering, and exploratory data\nanalysis. A total of 69 stages were implemented into MLPrE, of which we\nhighlight and demonstrate key stages using six diverse datasets. We further\nhighlight MLPrE's ability to independently process multiple fields in flat\nfiles and recombine them, otherwise requiring an additional pipeline, using a\nUniProt glossary term dataset. Building on this advantage, we demonstrated the\nclustering stage with available wine quality data. Lastly, we demonstrate the\npreparation of data for a graph database in the final stages of MLPrE using\nphosphosite kinase data. Overall, our MLPrE tool offers a generalizable and\nscalable tool for preprocessing and early data analysis, filling a critical\nneed for such a tool given the ever expanding use of machine learning. This\ntool serves to accelerate and simplify early stage development in larger\nworkflows."}

However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances\nseparately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby\npatches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a\nsynthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features\nis crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of\noff-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the\noptimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We\nempirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize\nas well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of\ninstances."}

Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample\nbetween arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and\ntheir latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using\nconditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve\nproperties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling\nbetween arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at\nlarge time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world\ntracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy\ncomparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for\narbitrary time-point sampling."}
