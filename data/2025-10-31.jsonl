This linearity encodes the superposition\nprinciple, a key feature of quantum theory. However, this principle can break\ndown in effective non-Hermitian dynamics arising from postselected quantum\nevolution. We theoretically characterize and experimentally investigate this\nbreakdown in a dissipative superconducting transmon circuit. Within the\ncircuit's three-level manifold, no-jump postselection generates an effective\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian governing the excited two-level subspace and an\nanti-Hermitian nonlinearity. We prepare different initial states and use\nquantum state tomography to track their evolution under this effective,\nnonlinear Hamiltonian. By comparing the evolution of a superposition-state to a\nsuperposition of individually-evolved basis states, we test linearity and\nobserve clear violations which we quantify across the exceptional-point (EP)\ndegeneracy of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the analysis to density\nmatrices, revealing a breakdown in linearity for the two-level subspace while\ndemonstrating that linearity is preserved in the full three-level system. These\nresults provide direct evidence of nonlinearity in non-Hermitian quantum\nevolution, highlighting unique features that are absent in classical\nnon-Hermitian systems."}

Beam pointing stability has been traditionally achieved using\nsimple proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control which removes the problem\nof slow drift, but is limited because of the time delay in knowing the\ndiagnosis and the inertia in the mechanical system associated with mirrors. In\nthis work, we introduce a predictive control strategy where the forecasting of\nbeam pointing errors is performed by a patch-based multilayer perceptron\n(Patch-MLP) designed to capture local temporal patterns for more robust\nshort-term jitter prediction. The subsequent conversion of these predicted\nerrors into correction signals is handled by a PID controller.

This performance gap has real\nconsequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial\npredictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses\nthe fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown\nbiases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?\nWe develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable\nsystematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the\nconcept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from\nobservable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is\nworthwhile for a given system.

This has led\nto increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose\ninternal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong\nperformance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ\nwhite-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.\nHowever, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same\ninstruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this\nmany-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we\nreinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the\noptimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction\nOptimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure\nof soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key\ncomponents: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft\nprompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial\ndata points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and\n(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency\nwithin each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of\neffectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,\nresulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33\ninstruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.\nCode is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/PRESTO"}

We used XGBoost models on data\nfrom 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance\nwith R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold\ncross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the\nembedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13\nof 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three\nembedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average\n5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),\nnew HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,\n0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with\nlow primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results\ndemonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for\nselect health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the\nintegration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for\nsupplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems."}

Unlike conventional approaches that search\nfor optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to\ntreat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we\noptimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,\nthereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound\nanalogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general\nrelativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of\n\"data-driven geometry\". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric\noptimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with\nfixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully\ndynamic \"meta-learners\" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and\ntopology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as\nscientific model discovery and robust representation learning."}

The key idea is\nto model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined\nby a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and\ncovariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein\npolynomials.

A common approach\ninvolves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method\noften results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in\nsample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling\ntechniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet\nrepresentative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic\ndistribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF\nestimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a\ntypical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the\nmodel forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the\nremaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory\nusage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline."}

In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models\ncan provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we\ncompare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two\nmodel-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best\nforecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even\nsurpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for\nclassification.

Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that\nits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric\nstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation\nlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering\nreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module."}
