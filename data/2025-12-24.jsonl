Traditional machine learning methods often struggle with the complexity and heterogeneity of EDA workloads, requiring extensive feature engineering and domain expertise. We propose a novel framework that fine-tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to address this challenge through text-to-text regression. We introduce the scientific notation and prefix filling to constrain the LLM, significantly improving output format reliability. Moreover, we found that full-attention finetuning and inference improves the prediction accuracy of sliding-window-attention LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on real-world cloud datasets, setting a new baseline for performance prediction in the EDA domain."}

While fully supervised techniques achieve high accuracy, they demand extensive labeled datasets that are costly to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised methods eliminate labeling needs but often deliver suboptimal performance. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation across the supervision spectrum for wearable-based HAR, with particular focus on novel approaches that minimize labeling requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy. We develop and empirically compare: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) a weakly supervised learning approach with constraints, (4) a multi-task learning approach with knowledge sharing, (5) a self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data. Experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that: (i) our weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches while significantly reducing supervision requirements; (ii) the proposed multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing between related tasks; (iii) our weakly self-supervised approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency with just 10\\% of labeled data. These results not only highlight the complementary strengths of different learning paradigms, offering insights into tailoring HAR solutions based on the availability of labeled data, but also establish that our novel weakly self-supervised framework offers a promising solution for practical HAR applications where labeled data are limited."}

The objective was to develop a multimodal deep learning model, using structured and unstructured clinical data, to predict in-hospital mortality risk among critically ill patients after their initial 24 hour intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID. A multimodal model was developed on the MIMIC datasets, featuring time series components occurring within the first 24 hours of ICU admission and predicting risk of subsequent inpatient mortality. Inputs included time-invariant variables, time-variant variables, clinical notes, and chest X-ray images. External validation occurred in a temporally separated MIMIC population, HiRID, and eICU datasets. A total of 203,434 ICU admissions from more than 200 hospitals between 2001 to 2022 were included, in which mortality rate ranged from 5.2% to 7.9% across the four datasets. The model integrating structured data points had AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier scores of 0.92, 0.53, and 0.19, respectively. We externally validated the model on eight different institutions within the eICU dataset, demonstrating AUROCs ranging from 0.84-0.92. When including only patients with available clinical notes and imaging data, inclusion of notes and imaging into the model, the AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier score improved from 0.87 to 0.89, 0.43 to 0.48, and 0.37 to 0.17, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating multiple sources of patient information for mortality prediction and the importance of external validation."}

We focus on Quasi-topological theories involving infinite towers of terms for which the unique vacuum spherically symmetric solutions correspond to regular black holes. We solve analytically the problem of constant-density stars and find that the space of solutions is bounded by: configurations with divergent central-pressure, corresponding to the most compact stars; configurations which possess zero central-pressure; and configurations for which the sizes of the stars coincide with the inner-horizon radii of the would-be regular black holes. In the more general case of perfect-fluid stars for which the mean density decreases with increasing radius, we show that, for each density profile, maximum compactness is reached when the metric becomes singular at the center. Under certain additional conditions, we find a novel Buchdahl limit for the maximum compactness of stars, attained by a specific constant-density profile. We show, in particular, that stars in these theories may be more compact than in Einstein gravity. While the vacuum solutions of these theories are such that all curvature invariants take mass-independent maximum finite values, we argue that there exist ordinary matter stars with finite central pressures for which such bounds can be violated -- namely, arbitrarily high curvatures can be reached -- unless additional constraints, such as the dominant energy condition, are imposed on the fluid."}

The purpose of this simulation program is to provide a fast computational workflow and an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for small to medium-sized projects. It features a ray-casting algorithm based on a voxel engine. The simulation domain is defined layerwise, whereas the geometry is extruded from a pixel matrix of materials, identified by specific numbers. Input files are a stack of pictures, all other settings, including the configuration of predefined sources, can be adjusted via the GUI. The scattering kernel features the treatment of elastic and inelastic collisions, absorption and absorption-like processes like evaporation. Cross sections, energy distributions and angular distributions are taken from evaluated data bases. In order to simulate boron-lined detectors it also models the charged particle transport following the conversion by computing the energy loss in the boron and its consecutive layer. The electron track is then projected onto a readout unit by longitudinal and transversal diffusion. URANOS is freely available and can be used to simulate the response function of boron-lined or epithermal neutron detectors, small-scale laboratory setups and especially transport studies of cosmic-ray induced environmental neutrons. It offers an easy accessibility and comparably simple interface capable of handling complex geometries. URANOS therefore offers possibilities to understand and simulate the neutron environment at instruments, which would otherwise require extensive modeling and training on dedicated packages."}

In this work, we discover that the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) can appear in a flat band. Unlike conventional NHSEs for dispersive bands that are protected by nontrivial point-gap topology, the flat band remains a point on the complex-energy plane and is therefore always topologically trivial. We found that, intriguingly, the flat-band skin effect (FBSE) is associated with the non-trivial spectral topology of the dispersive bands enclosing the flat band on the complex-energy plane, so it only emerges within a finite range of non-Hermitian parameters and can counterintuitively disappear at large non-Hermiticity. Moreover, the gaps between the flat and the dispersive bands can close at higher-order exceptional points under both periodic and open boundary conditions. The flat-band wavefunctions are discontinuous in quantum distance across these exceptional points, signifying that the gap-closing is singular. The FBSE was experimentally observed in a non-Hermitian mechanical lattice. Our work reveals flat-band phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems and highlights new possibilities in quantum geometry and localization control."}

First, we analytically investigate eternal quantum black hole solutions to a one-parameter family of analytically solvable models interpolating between Russo-Susskind-Thorlacius and Bose, Parker, and Peleg gravities. Examining these models in a semi-classically allowed parameter space, we find naked singularities may exist for quantum fields in the Boulware state. Using a quasi-local formalism, where we confine the black hole to a finite sized cavity, we derive the conserved energy and analyze the system's thermal behavior. Specifically, we show the semi-classical Wald entropy precisely equals the generalized entropy, accounting for both gravitational and fine grained matter entropies, and we find a range where the quantum black holes are thermally stable. Finally, we numerically construct eternal black hole solutions to semi-classical Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger gravity and find their thermal behavior is qualitatively different from their analytic counterparts. In the process, we develop an analytic expansion of the solutions and find it accurately approximates the full numerical solutions in the semi-classical limit."}

Most continuum scale models fail to capture the true nature of thermodynamic property variation across the interface, particularly under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. An improvement over the sharp interface assumption of such continuum scale models is the consideration of a diffused interface and using Kinetic Boundary Conditions (KBCs) to model the mass-transport across the liquid vapor interface. Prior studies on KBCs mainly address monoatomic fluids. Two of the main ingredients required to form KBCs are: density and mass flux. Here, we study a Type-III binary mixture of n-dodecane and nitrogen using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics at near-critical temperatures. Interfacial properties such as thickness, density gradient, and surface tension were analyzed. A key result is the temporal evolution of the evaporation and reflected mass fluxes across the vapor-liquid interface. We observe that both the evaporation and reflection fluxes increase with increasing temperature, indicating enhanced molecular activity and mass transport across the interface at higher Tr. In contrast, the evaporation coefficient alpha_evap decreases from about alpha approximately 0.978 at Tr equals 0.70 to alpha approximately 0.905 at Tr equals 0.95 because the reflected-out flux increases along with the evaporation flux, which reduces the net efficiency of molecular evaporation across the interface. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the very few studies estimating mass transport coefficients for Type-III binary systems, laying the foundation for KBCs in hydrocarbon and nitrogen mixtures."}

Given research directions of interest previously identified in arXiv: 1804.01797, besides converse upper bounds on the bit transmission rate obtained by the author in recent work (arXiv: 2507.03035), additional possibilities remain, including: (1) determining whether aspects of QKD dependent protocols can be incorporated into steps of QKD independent protocols; (2) whether there would be any amplification to the Quantum-classical performance gap that Alice and Bob can exploit towards prospective Quantum advantage; (3) formulating the conditions under which secrecy and authentication can be simultaneously achieved. To characterize the conditions for which secrecy can be achieved with high probability, we argue that there not only exists suitable protocols which enable Alice and Bob to map into the authenticated space of bit codewords with high probability, but also that forward conceptual channels, through cascading, can significantly increase Eve's probability of false acceptance. Albeit the fact that secrecy, along with conceputalizations of the public broadcast channel, were initially discussed by Maurer for QKD dependent protocols, determining whether aspects of such protocols can be adapted for unconditional security without the use of a secret key is of great interest to explore. We demonstrate that Eve's error probability, through the cascading procedure, can be analyzed with the Holevo information under an optimal decoder. Furthermore, through post-processing of the outputs of a Completely Positive Trace Preserving (CPTP) map, we also demonstrate how to decrease Holevo sum quantities with data-processing and entropy-continuity bounds."}

MDFA-Net consists of dual-path networks, the first path network, multiscale feature network (MF-Net) that maintains the shallow information and avoids missing information, and the second path network is an encoder network (EC-Net) that captures the continuous trend of the sequences and retains deep details. Integrating both deep and shallow attributes effectively grasps both local and global patterns.

The stability of these configurations is assessed through their dynamical evolution using a fully non-linear relativistic code. For stable configurations, we compute the oscillation spectrum and identify the fundamental mode frequency. We found that, while the isotropic and Horvat models become unstable close to the maximum-mass point, the Bowers-Liang and Covariant models become unstable at lower central densities, indicating that the standard turning-point criterion may not reliably predict the onset of dynamical instability in anisotropic stars. Based on our results, we also determine the neutral-stability line and verify that configurations lying to the right of this line are indeed unstable under radial perturbations and collapse. Overall, given an equation of state, pressure anisotropy can increase the maximum mass of an stable configuration by up to ~30 % compared to the isotropic case. It also allows for more compact stable configurations that may collapse on longer timescales once they become unstable. Finally, we show that these compact stars could initially mimic a black hole's gravitational-wave ringdown. However, the production of subsequent echoes is not guaranteed by high compactness; instead, it depends critically on the star's specific internal structure and equation of state."}

This paper addresses the notion and implementation of the immersed boundary method for the discrete velocity model of the Boltzmann equation. The method incorporates the Maxwell gas-surface interaction model into the construction of ghost-cell particle distribution functions, facilitating meticulous characterization of velocity slip and temperature jump effects within a Cartesian grid framework, which ultimately achieves accurate prediction of aerodynamic parameters. This study presents two principal advancements. First, an upwind-weighted compact interpolation strategy is developed in physical space, which ensures numerical stability and robustness for arbitrary geometries without relying on large stencils or normal-direction projections. Second, a cut-cell correction methodology is proposed in velocity space to address the degradation of quadrature accuracy caused by surface discontinuities. The resulting framework is equally applicable to both two- and three-dimensional problems without requiring any dimension-specific modifications. Rigorous analysis is provided to prove that the approach maintains second-order accuracy across both physical and velocity space, while ensuring robust numerical stability. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the solution algorithm achieves the designed accuracy and delivers precise predictions comparable to body-conformal solvers, while retaining the simplicity, flexibility, and scalability of the Cartesian grid method. The proposed approach provides a unified and physically consistent immersed boundary framework for simulating dynamic interactions between non-equilibrium flows and structural components across a wide range of flow regimes."}

As the disorder increases, we find that scalable spin squeezing survives only near the Heisenberg point. We show that this behavior is due to the presence of rare tightly-coupled dimers, which effectively heat the system post-quench.

This design preserves the compactness of 1-bit deltas while more accurately capturing variation across weight dimensions, leading to improved reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives. From a systems perspective, a streamlined loader that transfers packed deltas in a single operation per module reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead, with artifacts several times smaller than a full FP16 checkpoint.

We show that the CK invariants do not distinguish the $\\oplus$ and $\\times$ modes. Instead, we show that the Bardeen variables coincide with the Killing invariants obtained by projecting the metric perturbation onto the translational Killing vectors of the Minkowski background.

For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. We demonstrate that randPROMs may enable us to significantly reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction model for arrival time and height of tsunami waves."}

We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana \"metal\" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a \"metal to insulator\" transition..."}

Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via Möbius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications."}

This paper has four primary objectives: First, we establish the Petrov type classification of Nat'{a}rio's spacetime, which has not been previously determined in the literature. We prove that Nat'{a}rio's spacetime is Petrov type I, not fitting the Class B warped product spacetime definition. Second, we assess the relative magnitude of the Weyl scalar curvature invariant and compare it with the amplitudes of Einstein's scalar and the Ricci quadratic and cubic invariants within the warp-bubble zone. Previous studies have focused on Ricci curvature and the energy-momentum tensor, neglecting the Weyl curvature, which we demonstrate plays a significant role due to the sharp localization of the form function near the warp-bubble radius. Third, we visualize several curvature invariants for Nat'{a}rio's warp drive, as well as momentum density, which we show as the critical physical quantity governing the orientation of the warp drive trajectory, overshadowing space volume changes. Fourth, we critically examine claims that Nat'{a}rio's warp drive is more realistic than Alcubierre's. We demonstrate that Nat'{a}rio's spacetime exhibits curvature invariant amplitudes 35 times greater than Alcubierre's, given identical warp-bubble parameters, making Nat'{a}rio's concept even less viable. Additionally, we address Mattingly et al.'s analysis, highlighting their underestimation of curvature invariant amplitudes by 21 orders of magnitude."}

The key innovation lies in its operational efficiency, enabling real-time, quality-driven ML decision-making with minimal computational overhead. We validate the framework in a steel manufacturing company's Electroslag Remelting (ESR) vacuum pumping process, demonstrating a 12% improvement in model performance (R2 = 94%) and a fourfold reduction in prediction latency.

The inference further suggests that both black holes possess high spins, measured to be $0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$. Therefore, the observation of this event suggests the formation of black holes from channels beyond the standard stellar collapse. However, different waveform models yield significantly different parameter estimates, possibly due to missing physics in the models used in inference. In this work, we carry out a reanalysis of GW231123 using a physically complete model, accounting for both spin precession and eccentricity. Our analysis shows that this event does not exhibit strong evidence for eccentricity and the exclusion of eccentricity has minimal impact on inference. Furthermore, for GW231123-like systems, even eccentricities as large as $0.15$ at $10$ Hz do not yield a confident nonzero eccentricity measurement. Through a zero-noise injection recovery study, we show that the observed discrepancies in the parameter estimates can be explained by disagreement in the waveform models at strong spin precession, with the degree of parameter bias in the zero-noise runs being comparable to that observed for the real signal. We also show that inference performed with an eccentric, aligned-spin waveform model can yield a confident nonzero eccentricity measurement due to the degeneracy between eccentricity and spin precession. Bayesian model selection, however, rules out this interpretation in favor of the eccentric, spin precessing hypothesis, which supports zero eccentricity -- a conclusion we confirm with additional zero-noise injection-recovery tests."}

A phenomenological relation between ergotropy and entanglement is uncovered, which generalizes the existing free fermion integrable results to an interacting scenario. The ergotropy in a dynamical protocol shows that a reset with a global uniform coherent rotation can inject extractable energy, as a proof of principle way to charge a quantum \"battery\". Our protocol is tailored for near term Rydberg neutral atoms array, while also being feasible for other quantum processors.

From malware detection to enabling autonomous navigation, modern machine learning systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, as these models are deployed in ever-changing real-world scenarios, their ability to remain reliable and adaptive over time becomes increasingly important. For example, in the real world, new malware families are continuously developed, whereas autonomous driving cars are employed in many different cities and weather conditions. Models trained in fixed settings can not respond effectively to novel conditions encountered post-deployment. In fact, most machine learning models are still developed under the assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), i.e., sampled from the same underlying (unknown) distribution. While this assumption simplifies model development and evaluation, it does not hold in many real-world applications, where data changes over time and unexpected inputs frequently occur. Retraining models from scratch whenever new data appears is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-constrained environments. These limitations underscore the need for Continual Learning (CL), which enables models to incrementally learn from evolving data streams without forgetting past knowledge, and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, which allows systems to identify and respond to novel or anomalous inputs. Jointly addressing both challenges is critical to developing robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems."}

On the one hand, quantum information theory assumes subsystem locality, i.e.~the factorization of the total Hilbert space into subsystems. On the other hand, gauge constraints prevent the total Hilbert space to decompose into a spacetime-local tensor product structure. Because the Hilbert space structure of gauge theories does not accommodate the subsystem decomposition used in quantum information theory, standard information-theoretic results, such as the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) theorem, cannot be used straightforwardly in the context of gauge theories. In this work, we bridge this gap in the case of a two-dimensional lattice gauge model that captures key features of electromagnetism. In particular, we construct gauge-invariant local algebras and derive a physically meaningful decomposition of the Hilbert space, providing an operationally consistent notion of locality in the absence of a local tensor-product structure. We apply this framework to field-mediated entanglement protocols relevant to proposed tests of the quantum nature of gravity. We show that the discretized version of electromagnetism satisfies an analogue of the LOCC theorem: entanglement cannot be generated without genuine quantum field interactions, even in the absence of a spacetime-local tensor product factorization of the Hilbert space. This may point towards an operational way to define a subsystem structure for gauge theories."}

Training relies on estimating the gradient of the relative entropy between the target and model distributions, a task that is well understood when the classical Boltzmann machine has both visible and hidden units. For some years now, it has been an obstacle to generalize this finding to quantum state learning with quantum Boltzmann machines that have both visible and hidden units. In this paper, I derive an analytical expression for the gradient of the quantum relative entropy between a target quantum state and the reduced state of the visible units of a quantum Boltzmann machine. Crucially, this expression is amenable to estimation on a quantum computer, as it involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations reminiscent of those appearing in my prior work on rotated Petz recovery maps. This leads to a quantum algorithm for gradient estimation in this setting. I then specialize the setting to quantum visible units and classical hidden units, and vice versa, and provide analytical expressions for the gradients, along with quantum algorithms for estimating them. Finally, I replace the quantum relative entropy objective function with the Petz-Tsallis relative entropy; here I develop an analytical expression for the gradient and sketch a quantum algorithm for estimating it, as an application of a novel formula for the derivative of the matrix power function, which also involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations.

The field of technology forecasting has long relied on quantitative trend extrapolation techniques, such as growth curves (e.g., Moore's law) and time series models, to project technological progress. To assess the current state of these methods, we conducted an updated systematic literature review (SLR) that incorporates recent advances. This review highlights a growing trend toward machine learning-based hybrid models.\n  Motivated by this review, we developed a forecasting model that combines long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with an augmentation of Moore's law to predict spacecraft lifetimes. Operational lifetime is an important engineering characteristic of spacecraft and a potential proxy for technological progress in space exploration. Lifetimes were modeled as depending on launch date and additional predictors.\n  Our modeling analysis introduces a novel advance in the recently introduced Start Time End Time Integration (STETI) approach. STETI addresses a critical right censoring problem known to bias lifetime analyses: the more recent the launch dates, the shorter the lifetimes of the spacecraft that have failed and can thus contribute lifetime data. Longer-lived spacecraft are still operating and therefore do not contribute data. This systematically distorts putative lifetime versus launch date curves by biasing lifetime estimates for recent launch dates downward. STETI mitigates this distortion by interconverting between expressing lifetimes as functions of launch time and modeling them as functions of failure time. The results provide insights relevant to space mission planning and policy decision-making."}

This perspective is limiting in practice, as failures in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are frequently structured; solutions may appear convincing while containing subtle logical, algebraic, or numerical flaws. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) variants that rely on large reward models or LLM-as-a-judge signals are often expensive, difficult to scale, and unstable to iterate. We propose a lightweight and pragmatic post-training pipeline that targets such structured errors under realistic compute budgets. Starting from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, we introduce a compact MathVerifier that decomposes a candidate solution into a six-dimensional error profile and aggregates it into interpretable wrongness and absurdity scores. These verifier signals serve two roles: (i) mining hard negatives that are near-correct yet structurally flawed, and (ii) defining per-sample importance weights that emphasize the most informative preference pairs. We integrate both into an offline Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective via a verifier-guided weighted formulation. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 model show that verifier-guided, weighted DPO yields more targeted improvements than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, particularly on problems where solutions are numerically close to correct but logically inconsistent, while avoiding the overhead of training large reward models or relying on external judges."}

In the $μ_0$ scheme in which the quantum parameters are treated as constants, the equations of motion generated by the effective Hamiltonian are solved analytically. The resulting quantum-corrected effective spacetime obviously extends the effective spacetime previously obtained in the literature. In the new effective spacetime, the naked singularity and the central singularity presented in the classical JNW spacetime are resolved by a series of quantum bounces. In the scheme of choosing the quantum parameters as Dirac observables, the effective dynamics is also solved in the light of the solution in $μ_0$ scheme. It turns out that the resulting effective spacetime has singularities due to the appearance of the zero points of the time reparametrization functions.

To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ArcGen. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures.

By embedding the CoM offset induced coupling acceleration as an extended state in a model-based adaptive Kalman filter, we achieve estimation accuracy of 0.01-1.5 mm across all axes with a maximum error below 1%. This approach enables continuous, high-precision calibration during nominal observation runs, ensuring continuous and coherent gravitational wave data collection while maintaining the required precision, and also facilitating advanced DFACS functions such as performance evaluations and fault diagnosis.

Entanglement is generated sequentially through the successful absorption of a microwave photon wavepacket. This method enables deterministic entanglement generation, in contrast to a probabilistic mixing of two heralding signals on a balanced beamsplitter. Furthermore, our GBMQR employs an all-bosonic entanglement swapping Bell-state measurement.

Our approach circumvents mode-mismatch losses associated with routing and interfering of heralding modes on a beamsplitter, and confines losses to those arising from stationary storage.

Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98.

On the one hand, quantum information theory assumes subsystem locality, i.e.~the factorization of the total Hilbert space into subsystems. On the other hand, gauge constraints prevent the total Hilbert space to decompose into a spacetime-local tensor product structure. Because the Hilbert space structure of gauge theories does not accommodate the subsystem decomposition used in quantum information theory, standard information-theoretic results, such as the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) theorem, cannot be used straightforwardly in the context of gauge theories. In this work, we bridge this gap in the case of a two-dimensional lattice gauge model that captures key features of electromagnetism. In particular, we construct gauge-invariant local algebras and derive a physically meaningful decomposition of the Hilbert space, providing an operationally consistent notion of locality in the absence of a local tensor-product structure. We apply this framework to field-mediated entanglement protocols relevant to proposed tests of the quantum nature of gravity. We show that the discretized version of electromagnetism satisfies an analogue of the LOCC theorem: entanglement cannot be generated without genuine quantum field interactions, even in the absence of a spacetime-local tensor product factorization of the Hilbert space. This may point towards an operational way to define a subsystem structure for gauge theories."}

Realizing single-qubit control predicted beyond semi-classical, time-dependent modeling has yet to be experimentally realized on superconducting and most other computing platforms. In this regime, the common model of dynamics within a three-level manifold breaks down, and instead, we see new quantum error channels growing abruptly with decreasing time. To identify these error processes we systematically calculate the effect of multi-photon transitions that occur out of the computational space. We then derive analytical formulas to suppress these effects, as well as amplitude and phase errors on the qubit space; we term these R1D for suppressing the $|0\\rangle-|2\\rangle$ transition and R2D when also suppressing $|1\\rangle-|3\\rangle$ leakage. We also answer long-standing questions about the optimal values of the DRAG prefactor as well as constant detuning, when accounting for time-ordering, and also show how to calibrate other prefactors for further performance improvement. Upon correcting these varied sources of error, we numerically demonstrate gate infidelities below $10^{-5}$ for a 7ns $π$-rotation when incorporating existing decoherence rates."}

We give exact formulas governing the ORT measure of a broad class of rank-two mixed states, and numerical solutions for some higher-rank states. We also compare the nonclassicality of these states to their metrological power, thus showing in what regimes the metrological power manages to saturate the ORT bound.

A LightGBM regression model generates station-level demand forecasts, which serve as context for a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that selects buffer levels from a discrete action set.

However, realizing accurate KWS models on ultra-low-power TinyML devices (often with less than $<2$ MB of flash memory) necessitates a delicate balance between accuracy with strict resource constraints. Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) is an ideal candidate for managing such a trade-off but is highly initialization-dependent, especially under the budgeted black-box setting. Existing methods typically fall back to naive, ad-hoc sampling routines (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, or Random search) that are adapted to neither the Pareto front nor undergo rigorous statistical comparison. To address this, we propose Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), a novel initialization strategy that leverages Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a seed Pareto set of high-performing and diverse configurations that explicitly balance accuracy and model size. Evaluated in a TinyML KWS setting, OASI outperforms LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and the lowest generational distance (0.0) across multiple runs, with only a modest increase in computation time (1934 s vs. $\\sim$1500 s). A non-parametric statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test ($H = 5.40$, $p = 0.144$, $η^2 = 0.0007$) and Dunn's post-hoc test confirms OASI's superior consistency despite the non-significant overall difference with respect to the $α=0.05$ threshold."}

In QIA, operators are expressed as structured combinations of basis elements indexed by Boolean codes, allowing products, commutators, and conjugations to be computed through finite rules on discrete indices rather than through dense matrix arithmetic. This representation unifies combinatorial index structure, explicit matrix realization, and transformation properties under Walsh-Hadamard-type transforms within a single formalism. Using QIA and its associated block-matrix realization, we reformulate the Bernstein-Vazirani hidden-string problem in its phase-oracle form entirely within a real, finite-dimensional algebraic setting. We show that, under structured oracle access, the QIA procedure reproduces the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm exactly and achieves the same asymptotic query complexity and circuit depth as the standard quantum algorithm. In particular, the hidden string is recovered by symbolic manipulation of a sparse algebraic representation of the oracle rather than by numerical simulation of quantum amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that the apparent quantum speed-up in this setting is a consequence of operator structure rather than Hilbert-space dimensionality alone. QIA thus provides a precise language for separating genuinely quantum resources from those arising from algebraic and combinatorial structures and offers a new perspective on the classical simulability of structured quantum circuits."}

Selecting an effective architecture is challenging and closely related to the classical difficulty of choosing suitable neural-network topologies, which is computationally hard. This work investigates automated quantum-circuit construction for regression tasks and introduces a genetic-algorithm framework that discovers Reduced Regressor QNN architectures. The approach explores depth, parametrized gate configurations, and flexible data re-uploading patterns, formulating the construction of quantum regressors as an optimization process. The discovered circuits are evaluated against seventeen classical regression models on twenty-two nonlinear benchmark functions and four analytical functions. Although classical methods often achieve comparable results, they typically require far more parameters, whereas the evolved quantum models remain compact while providing competitive performance. We further analyze dataset complexity using twelve structural descriptors and show, across five increasingly challenging meta-learning scenarios, that these measures can reliably predict which quantum architecture will perform best. The results demonstrate perfect or near-perfect predictive accuracy in several scenarios, indicating that complexity metrics offer powerful and compact representations of dataset structure and can effectively guide automated model selection. Overall, this study provides a principled basis for meta-learning-driven quantum architecture design and advances the understanding of how quantum models behave in regression settings--a topic that has received limited exploration in prior work. These findings pave the way for more systematic and theoretically grounded approaches to quantum regression."}

Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline.

In this context, this paper proposes an $\\mathscr{H}_2$ model reduction method for the augmented model of linear non-Markovian quantum systems. We first establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the physical realizability of the augmented model of linear non-Markovian quantum systems, which are more stringent than those for Markovian quantum systems.

To solve the problem, we derive necessary conditions for determining the input matrix in the reduced model, with which a theorem for designing the system matrix of the ancillary system in the reduced system is proved. Building on this, we convert the nonlinear equality constraints into inequality constraints so that a semidefinite programming algorithm can be developed to solve the optimization problem for model reduction.\n  A numerical example of a two-mode linear quantum system driven by three internal modes of a non-Markovian environment validates the effectiveness of our method."}

However, the dynamic characteristics of satellite network topology, limited quantum resources, and strict coherence time constraints pose significant challenges to reliable entanglement routing. An entanglement distribution analysis model for this unique environment is critical and helpful for entanglement routing research. We address the fundamental challenge of establishing and maintaining quantum entanglement links between satellites operating in free space, where links are subject to both transmission losses and quantum memory decoherence. This paper presents a comprehensive Markov chain model with a state space defined by link storage age and physical distance for analyzing entanglement distribution in noisy dynamic LEO satellite quantum networks. We construct transition matrices that capture system dynamics under varying request arrival rates, and derive analytical expressions for key performance metrics, including request satisfaction rate, average waiting time, link utilization efficiency, and average consumed link fidelity. Our analysis reveals that the critical trade-offs of higher request rates lead to faster link consumption with higher fidelity but potentially lower satisfaction rates, while lower request rates allow longer storage times at the cost of lower fidelity of increased decoherence effect. Moreover, this paper proves it is reasonable to leave out polarization rotation when the transmission distance is very short (40-50 km).

This paper is the first to analyze the susceptibility of such ML classifiers to physical fault-injection which can result in generation of incorrect readout results from quantum computers. The study targets 5-qubit (thus 32-class) readout error-correction model. Using the ChipWhisperer Husky for physical voltage glitching, this work leverages an automated algorithm for scanning the fault injection parameter search space to find various successful faults in all the layers of the target ML model. Across repeated trials, this work finds that fault susceptibility is strongly layer-dependent: early-layers demonstrate higher rates of misprediction when faults are triggered in them, whereas later layers have smaller misprediction rates.

MASS introduces two key advancements: (i) a gradient-based semantic drift detector that prompts targeted expert expansion when the existing expert pool lacks capacity to capture the full semantic diversity of the data, and (ii) an integration of adaptive routing strategy that dynamically adjusts expert usage based on token-level routing confidence mass. We first demonstrate that MASS reliably converges to the point of optimal balance between cost-performance trade-off with notably improved sematic specialization in a highly controlled synthetic setup.

The setup consists of an optomechanical cavity with a movable mirror, a fixed semi transparent mirror, an ensemble of quantum dots (QD) coupled to the cavity mode, and an intracavity optical parametric amplifier (OPA). We show how the QD induced response, together with the system nonlinearity, modifies the noise spectral density and thereby improves the force measurement sensitivity. In this setup, coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) can completely remove the back action noise. In addition, increasing the OPA pump gain enables sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL) at reduced laser power. These combined effects allow weak force sensing beyond the SQL."}

We present an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on graph attention networks for sequential transit network construction. To address the long-horizon credit assignment challenge, we introduce a two-level reward structure combining incremental topological feedback with simulation-based terminal rewards. We evaluate our approach on a new real-world dataset from Bloomington, Indiana with topologically accurate road networks, census-derived demand, and existing transit routes. Our learned policies substantially outperform existing designs and traditional heuristics across two initialization schemes and two modal-split scenarios. Under high transit adoption with transit center initialization, our approach achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9\\% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to the real-world network. Under mixed-mode conditions with random initialization, it delivers 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics and 5.9% lower travel times than shortest path construction. These results demonstrate that end-to-end RL can design transit networks that substantially outperform both human-designed systems and hand-crafted heuristics on realistic city-scale benchmarks."}

Our development eliminates the need to optimise for the best probe state, while highlighting aspects of detector analysis that fundamentally differ from quantum state estimation. Through proofs, examples and experimental validation, we demonstrate the relevance and robustness of our proposal for current quantum detector technologies.

For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. We demonstrate that randPROMs may enable us to significantly reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction model for arrival time and height of tsunami waves."}

Firstly, the general theoretical framework of optimizing the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) scheme based on the dynamical quantum geometric tensor is given, and then the dynamical quantum geometric tensor and the nonadiabatic transition rate are calculated by taking the detuned $Λ$-type three-level system and tripod-type four-level system for example. Secondly, the transfer dynamics of the particle population of the system are investigated in detail. For a three-level system, the optimal STIRAP scheme has an efficiency of over 98\\% in transferring the population to the final state, while the transfer efficiency of traditional STIRAP is about 72\\%. The superposition states with arbitrary proportions can be efficiently prepared for a four-level system due to the decoupling of the degenerate dark states. Finally, the influences of system parameters, such as the operation time of the Rabi pulses, the amplitude fluctuation and the single-photon detuning, on the transfer process are discussed. Especially, the phenomenon of the adiabatic resonance transfer is revealed. Choosing the pulse parameters in the resonance window can reduce the infidelity of the population transfer to below $10^{-3}$. It is found that the optimal STIRAP scheme by the dynamical quantum geometric tensor provides faster and more efficient transfer than the traditional STIRAP scheme."}

While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal. We conduct an extensive empirical study to determine which adaptation paradigm - fine-tuning, in-context learning, or our proposed unified approach offers the best predictive performance on a concrete data downstream-tasks."}

Although Si/SiGe heterostructures are commonly used to host spin qubits due to their high mobility and low percolation density, the SiGe spacer creates a gap between the qubits and control electrodes, which limits the ability to tune exchange coupling. As a result, residual coupling leads to unwanted single-qubit phase shifts, making multi-qubit control more difficult. In this work, we explore swapping the roles of overlapping nanogates to overcome this issue. By reconfiguring the gate voltages, we demonstrate in situ role switching while maintaining multi-qubit control. Additionally, this method significantly improves the tunability of exchange coupling by several orders of magnitude over the traditional approach. This strategy reduces unintended single-qubit phase shifts and minimizes the complexity of multi-qubit control, supporting scalable growth with minimal experimental overhead."}

However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge. In the \"best-of-$k$\" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $Θ(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory. These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data. Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades."}

Current non-ergodic GMMs rely on Gaussian Process (GP) methods with prescribed correlation functions and thus have computational limitations for large-scale predictions. This study proposes a deep-learning approach called Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) as an alternative to GP-based methods for modeling non-ergodic path effects in Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS). CGM-FAS uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlation directly from data by using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables. Using San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, we compare CGM-FAS against a recent GP-based GMM for the region and demonstrate consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects. Additionally, CGM-FAS offers advantages compared to GP-based approaches in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid predictions, generating maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory. CGM-FAS hyperparameters can be tuned to ensure generated path effects exhibit variability consistent with the GP-based empirical GMM.

Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy.

We analytically derive the optimal dispersion relations in the limit of small and large qubit-qubit separations, and numerically extend our results to arbitrary separations via multiparameter optimization.

This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments."}

To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts.

We find that only a single exceptional point (EP) emerges, in contrast to non-Hermitian spin--boson models with finite modes, which typically exhibit multiple EPs. Notably, only a single real eigenvalue is found before the EP, which differs markedly from typical non-Hermitian systems where a pair of real eigenvalues precedes the EP. The time evolution of observables is further investigated via the Dirac--Frenkel time-dependent variational principle. Compared to its Hermitian counterpart, the non-Hermitian model exhibits distinct dynamical signatures, most notably the emergence of oscillations with periodic amplified amplitude. In the $\\mathcal{PT}$-unbroken phase, the system exhibits sustained oscillatory dynamics with suppressed decoherence, whereas in the $\\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, additional dissipative channels accelerate decoherence and drive rapid convergence toward a stable steady state.

In this work, we reconcile these approaches by unifying both estimators within the principled framework of control variates. We introduce the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), deriving an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum.

While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions."}

In this work, we introduce a simple variant of the model in which this ergodic behaviour is suppressed by introducing a spatial inhomogeneity in the interaction strengths. For this we partition the chain into two equal segments within which the spins interact with different coupling strengths. The ratio of these couplings defines an inhomogeneity parameter, whose variation away from unity leads to constrained dynamics. We characterize this crossover using multiple diagnostics, such as the long-time saturation of out-of-time-ordered correlators, level-spacing statistics, and the spectral form factor. We further examine the consequences for operator growth in Krylov space and for entanglement generation in the system's eigenstates. Together, these results demonstrate that introducing a macroscopic inhomogeneity in coupling strengths provides a minimal, disorder-free route to breaking ergodicity in this specific model of interacting spins."}

Advanced deep learning methodologies, particularly Transformer-based and MLP-based architectures, have achieved competitive predictive performance in cryptocurrency forecasting tasks. However, cryptocurrency data is inherently composed of long-term socio-economic trends and local high-frequency speculative oscillations. Existing deep learning-based 'black-box' models fail to effectively decouple these composite dynamics or provide the interpretability needed for trustworthy financial decision-making. To overcome these limitations, we propose DecoKAN, an interpretable forecasting framework that integrates multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for decoupling and hierarchical signal decomposition with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) mixers for transparent and interpretable nonlinear modeling. The DWT component decomposes complex cryptocurrency time series into distinct frequency components, enabling frequency-specific analysis, while KAN mixers provide intrinsically interpretable spline-based mappings within each decomposed subseries. Furthermore, interpretability is enhanced through a symbolic analysis pipeline involving sparsification, pruning, and symbolization, which produces concise analytical expressions offering symbolic representations of the learned patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DecoKAN achieves the lowest average Mean Squared Error on all tested real-world cryptocurrency datasets (BTC, ETH, XMR), consistently outperforming a comprehensive suite of competitive state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate DecoKAN's potential to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and model transparency, advancing trustworthy decision support within complex cryptocurrency markets."}

The normalized eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenspectra are derived within a non-Hermitian framework, ensuring consistent probability densities.

The study reveals distinct regimes of spectral characteristics arising from the interplay of complex mass, the Morse parameter, and eigenvalues, leading to the emergence of five intrinsic matter types. By analysing the energy eigenspectra, normalization conditions, and probability density profiles across parameter space, we identify regimes corresponding to real-spectrum Hermitian-like matter, quasi-stable or resonant states, purely complex quantum matter, non-physical, non-normalizable states, and a quasi-classical determinate regime in which the probability density becomes spatially static. One of these system exhibits a non-dissipative, collisionless state with long-range gravitational-like characteristics, suggesting a theoretical analogue for dark matter within a non-Hermitian quantum framework. Further, the five identified classes of matter may be interpreted as distinct phases of a single quantum system governed by complex mass and Morse parameters This classification elucidates the boundary between physical and non-physical regimes in complex quantum systems and provides a unified approach for interpreting stability, resonance, and emergent classicality arising from complex parameters."}

This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring\" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming."}

Both $\\mathbf{A\\cdot p}$ and $\\mathbf{d\\cdot E}$ interactions are included in the unified gauge, which is truly gauge equivalent to the minimum coupling principle. The Coulomb and dipole interactions are just the special cases of unified gauge. Remarkably three interactions lead to the same results under the resonant condition of field-atom frequencies, while significant difference appears in red and blue detunings. The QPT is analyzed in terms of spin coherent-state variational method, which indicates the abrupt changes of energy spectrum, average photon number as well as the atomic population at the critical point of interaction constant. Crucially, we reveal the sensitive dependence on the initial optical-phase, which is particularly useful to test the validity of three gauges experimentally. The non-Hermitian atom-field interaction results in the exceptional point (EP), beyond which the semiclassical energy function becomes complex. However the energy spectrum of variational ground state is real in the absence of EP, and does not become complex. The superradiant state is unstable due to the non-Hermitian interaction induced photon-number loss. Thus only the NP exists in the non-Hermitian Dicke Model Hamiltonian."}

In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds. This work serves as a pedagogical synthesis, aiming to bridge concepts from reinforcement learning and information theory for an audience of statistical physicists."}

However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines."}

For unitary parameter encoding generated by local Hamiltonians, such enhancement is characterized by superlinear scaling of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) with system size. Despite extensive progress, a systematic understanding of which many-body quantum states can exhibit this scaling has remained elusive. Here, we develop a general framework that connects metrological performance to long-range entanglement, state-preparation complexity, and quantum error-correction properties. We prove that super-linear QFI scaling necessarily requires long-range entanglement by deriving rigorous complexity-dependent upper bounds on the QFI. We further show that, for two broad classes of quantum error-correcting codes, nondegenerate codes and Calderbank--Shor--Steane quantum low-density parity-check codes, a nonconstant code distance precludes super-linear QFI scaling for a wide class of local Hamiltonians, revealing a fundamental incompatibility between metrological sensitivity and protection against local noise. Finally, we identify constructive routes that evade this obstruction by exploiting asymmetric code structures. In particular, we show that states associated with classical low-density parity-check codes, as well as asymmetric toric code states, both having asymmetric logical distances, can achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling. Together, our results establish long-range entanglement and asymmetric error correction as the essential resource underlying quantum metrology and clarify the interplay among state complexity, error correction, and metrological power."}

They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions."}

Our approach integrates the transpilation of the QEC gadgets into native trapped-ion primitives and a detailed account of the specific laser addressing and ion transport leading to different amounts of crosstalk errors, motional excitation and idle qubit errors. Combining a microscopically-informed noise model with an efficient Pauli-frame simulator and different scalable decoders, we assess the near-term performance of the color-code memory and teleportation protocols on these architectures. Our analysis demonstrates that modular color-code teleportation is achievable in these near-term trapped-ion architectures, and identifies the integrated-photonics connectivity as the most promising route for longer-term scaling."}

For each kernel type, we perform an extensive hyperparameter optimization of our tuning algorithm. We confirm the validity of a quantum-inspired approach based on statevector simulation by numerically demonstrating the superiority of two studied quantum kernels over the canonical classical RBF kernel. Finally, we discuss the pathway towards real quantum hardware, mainly driven by a transition to shot-based simulations and evaluating quantum kernels via randomized measurements, which can mitigate the effect of gate errors. The very low qubit requirements and moderate circuit depths, together with a minimal number of trainable circuit parameters, make our method particularly NISQ-friendly."}

We analyze a multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns a shared representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data. Under standard realizability and coverage assumptions commonly used in offline reinforcement learning, we establish finite-sample generalization guarantees for the learned value functions. Our analysis explicitly characterizes how pooling data across tasks improves estimation accuracy, yielding a $1/\\sqrt{nT}$ dependence on the total number of samples across tasks, while retaining the usual dependence on the horizon and concentrability coefficients arising from distribution shift. In addition, we consider a downstream offline setting in which a new task shares the same underlying representation as the upstream tasks. We study how reusing the representation learned during the multitask phase affects value estimation for this new task, and show that it can reduce the effective complexity of downstream learning relative to learning from scratch. Together, our results clarify the role of shared representations in multitask offline Q-learning and provide theoretical insight into when and how multitask structure can improve generalization in model-free, value-based reinforcement learning."}

This is particularly relevant in EO, where labeled data are often costly to obtain and limited in availability. However, classical DMs still face significant computational limitations, requiring hundreds to thousands of inference steps, as well as difficulties in capturing the intricate spatial and spectral correlations characteristic of EO data. Recent research in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), including initial attempts of Quantum Generative Models, offers a fundamentally different approach to overcome these challenges. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce the Quanvolutional Conditioned U-Net (QCU-Net), a hybrid quantum--classical architecture that applies quantum operations within a conditioned diffusion framework using a novel quanvolutional feature-extraction approach, for generating synthetic labeled EO imagery. Extensive experiments on the EuroSAT RGB dataset demonstrate that our QCU-Net achieves superior results. Notably, it reduces the Fréchet Inception Distance by 64%, lowers the Kernel Inception Distance by 76%, and yields higher semantic accuracy. Ablation studies further reveal that strategically positioning quantum layers and employing entangling variational circuits enhance model performance and convergence.

Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment."}

In this study, we propose a quantum blockchain protocol whose protection mechanism is directly derived from quantum mechanical principles. The protocol combines high-dimensional Bell states, time-entanglement, entanglement switching, and high-dimensional superdense coding. Encoding classical block information into time-delimited qudit states allows block identity and data verification to be implemented through the causal sequencing of quantum measurements instead of cryptographic hash functions. High-dimensional coding increases the information capacity per quantum carrier and improves noise resistance. Time-entanglement provides distributed authentication, non-repudiation, and tamper detection across the blockchain. Each block derives its own public-private key pair directly from the observed quantum correlations by performing high-dimensional Bell state measurements in successive time steps. Because these keys are dependent on the time ordering of measurements, attempts to alter block data or disrupt the protocol's timing structure inevitably affect the reconstructed correlations and are revealed during validation. Recent advances in the creation and detection of high-dimensional time-slice entanglement demonstrate that the necessary quantum resources are compatible with emerging quantum communication platforms. Taken together, these considerations suggest that the proposed framework can be evaluated as a viable and scalable candidate for quantum-secure blockchain architectures in future quantum network environments."}

Previous studies have shown that such systems can support nonlocal coherent states (NCS). In this work, we demonstrate that NCS can dynamically evolve into nonlocal cat states under the influence of a nonlocal Hamiltonian -- specifically, the square of the total number operator. Crucially, the resulting dynamics cannot be decomposed into local factors. Furthermore, we explore broader mathematical implications of these phenomena within the framework of generalized bosons. Our findings highlight that the concepts of coherent states and nonlocal cat states are not inherently bound together; rather, their fusion is a distinctive feature of standard bosons. Finally, we propose that if the generalized boson framework can be physically realized in engineered quantum systems, the phenomena described here may hold significant relevance for both physics and materials science."}

However, when the information is imprinted on both, this no longer holds true: we construct a simple global Gaussian measurement where the Fisher information becomes super additive. These results can improve parameter estimation tasks via feasible tools. Namely, in quantum optical platforms our proposed global operation requires only passive global operations and single mode Gaussian measurements. We demonstrate this in two examples where we estimate squeezing and losses. While in the former case there is a significant gap between the Fisher information of the optimal Gaussian measurement and the quantum Fisher information for a single copy, this gap can be reduced with joint Gaussian measurements and closed in the asymptotic limit of many copies."}

Grounded in the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis, CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks.

The core idea is to \\textit{disentangle} the target MPS using a sequence of optimised local unitaries, and then reverse this process to obtain a state preparation circuit. Specifically, we define a loss function directly on the Schmidt spectra of intermediate states and use automatic differentiation to optimise each circuit layer so as to systematically reduce entanglement entropy. Once a disentangling sequence has been learned, we take the adjoints of the optimised unitaries to obtain a shallow-depth circuit that approximately reconstructs the target MPS from the computational all-zero state. We benchmark SSO across a range of MPS approximations to the ground states of local Hamiltonians and demonstrate state-of-the-art shallow-depth performance, improving accuracy by up to an order of magnitude over existing methods. Finally, we provide numerical evidence that SSO mitigates the adverse time-complexity scaling observed in previous disentangling-based approaches."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \\textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks.

These issues become especially pronounced in the strong noise regime for gates with fidelities around $90\\%$. To address these limitations, we introduce an extended CSB model together with a fidelity estimate interval (FEI) -- an interval-valued estimate of the target gate fidelity. Numerical simulation demonstrates that FEI remains sufficiently narrow, with its midpoint reliably approximating the true fidelity. We further validate the protocol on a trapped-ion quantum processor by benchmarking two implementations of the three-qubit Toffoli gate.

Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds."}

In particular, we investigate Wolfram model multiway rewriting systems based on string substitutions. Multiway systems were proposed by S. Wolfram as generic model systems for multicomputational processes, emphasizing their significance as a foundation for modeling complexity, nondeterminism, and branching structures of measurement outcomes. Here, we investigate a specific class of multiway systems based on cyclic character strings with a neighborhood constraint - the latter called Leibnizian strings. We show that such strings exhibit a Fermi-Dirac distribution for expectation values of occupation numbers of character neighborhoods. A Leibnizian string serves as an abstraction of a $N$-fermion system. A multiway system of these strings encodes causal relations between rewriting events in a nondeterministic manner. The collection of character strings realizes a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module with a symmetric $\\mathbb{Z}$-bilinear form. For discrete spaces, this generalizes the notion of an inner product over a vector field. This admits a discrete analogue of the path integral and a $S$-matrix for multiway systems of Leibnizian strings. The elements of this $S$-matrix yield transition amplitudes between states of the multiway system based on an action defined over a sequence of Leibnizian strings. We then show that these $S$-matrices give explicit representations of quantum gates for qubits and qudits, and also circuits composed of such gates. We find that, as formal models of nondeterministic computation, rewriting systems of Leibnizian strings with causal structure encode representations of the CNOT, $π/8$, and Hadamard gates. Hence, using multiway systems one can represent quantum circuits for qubits."}

The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling.

We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data.

This consists in a procedure to transform $n$ parallel queries of an arbitrary quantum channel into $n$ parallel queries of the same uniformly random Stinespring isometry, via universal encoding and decoding operations that are efficiently implementable. When the channel is promised to have Choi rank at most $r$, the procedure can be tailored to yield a Stinespring environment of dimension $r$. As a consequence, quantum channel learning reduces to isometry learning, yielding a simple channel learning algorithm, based on existing isometry learning protocols, that matches the performance of the two recently proposed channel tomography algorithms. Complementarily, whereas the optimality of these algorithms had previously been established only up to a logarithmic factor in the dimension, we close this gap by removing this logarithmic factor from the lower bound. Taken together, our results fully establish the optimality of these recently introduced channel learning algorithms, showing that the optimal query complexity of learning a quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ is $Θ(d_A d_B r)$."}

We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries. Notably, BRIDGE defies the conventional cost-performance frontier, surpassing direct distillation baselines that use 100% of the budget while consuming only 5% of the resources."}

By mapping the ladder onto two decoupled non-Hermitian Su--Schrieffer--Heeger (SSH) chains, we uncover a rich structure in parameter space under different boundary conditions. Under periodic boundary conditions, the spectrum admits a fine-tuned line in parameter space with entirely real eigenvalues, while deviations from this line induce a real--complex spectral transition without crossing exceptional points. In contrast, an exact analytical diagonalization under open boundary conditions reveals extended regions in parameter space with purely real or purely imaginary spectra, separated from complex spectral domains by exceptional lines. The intersections of these exceptional lines define triple-junction points where distinct spectral regimes meet, giving rise to a structured phase diagram that is absent under periodic boundary conditions. We further show that flat bands in this system can occur both as Hermitian diabolical points and as non-Hermitian exceptional points, known as exceptional flat bands, where the dynamics is more stringent than in the Hermitian case, leading to distinct spectral and dynamical signatures."}

Explainability is key to building user trust and meeting transparency requirements. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is a popular explainable AI framework, but it lacks efficient implementations for time series and often assumes feature independence when sampling counterfactuals. We introduce SHAPformer, an accurate, fast and sampling-free explainable time-series forecasting model based on the Transformer architecture. It leverages attention manipulation to make predictions based on feature subsets. SHAPformer generates explanations in under one second, several orders of magnitude faster than the SHAP Permutation Explainer. On synthetic data with ground truth explanations, SHAPformer provides explanations that are true to the data. Applied to real-world electrical load data, it achieves competitive predictive performance and delivers meaningful local and global insights, such as identifying the past load as the key predictor and revealing a distinct model behavior during the Christmas period."}

We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It \"fails fast\" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and \"wins big\" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads.

While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability."}

However, training data quality control has received little attention in the literature, despite data quality varying considerably with the tagging exercise. We propose methods to evaluate and enhance the quality of hand-tagged training data using statistical approaches to measure tagging consistency and agreement. We show that agreement metrics give more reliable results if recorded over multiple iterations of tagging, where declining variance in such recordings is an indicator of increasing data quality. We also show one way a tagging project can collect high-quality training data without requiring multiple tags for every work item, and that a tagger burn-in period may not be sufficient for minimizing tagger errors."}

The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization."}

During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term \"internal RL\", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models."}

Despite being widely observed across architectures, existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework. We present a theoretical framework that explains a simplicity bias arising from saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for a general class of neural networks, incorporating fully-connected, convolutional, and attention-based architectures. Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold. Our analysis also illuminates the effects of data distribution and weight initialization on the duration and number of plateaus in learning, dissociating previously confounding factors. Overall, our theory offers a framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions."}

Wilde"], "title": "Fundamentals of quantum Boltzmann machine learning with visible and hidden units", "comment": "61 pages, 1 figure", "summary": "One of the primary applications of classical Boltzmann machines is generative modeling, wherein the goal is to tune the parameters of a model distribution so that it closely approximates a target distribution. Training relies on estimating the gradient of the relative entropy between the target and model distributions, a task that is well understood when the classical Boltzmann machine has both visible and hidden units. For some years now, it has been an obstacle to generalize this finding to quantum state learning with quantum Boltzmann machines that have both visible and hidden units. In this paper, I derive an analytical expression for the gradient of the quantum relative entropy between a target quantum state and the reduced state of the visible units of a quantum Boltzmann machine. Crucially, this expression is amenable to estimation on a quantum computer, as it involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations reminiscent of those appearing in my prior work on rotated Petz recovery maps. This leads to a quantum algorithm for gradient estimation in this setting. I then specialize the setting to quantum visible units and classical hidden units, and vice versa, and provide analytical expressions for the gradients, along with quantum algorithms for estimating them. Finally, I replace the quantum relative entropy objective function with the Petz-Tsallis relative entropy; here I develop an analytical expression for the gradient and sketch a quantum algorithm for estimating it, as an application of a novel formula for the derivative of the matrix power function, which also involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations. Ultimately, this paper demarcates progress in training quantum Boltzmann machines with visible and hidden units for generative modeling and quantum state learning."}
