Two distinct\nlimitations are taken into account to solve the field equations, including\ndifferent forms of the radial geometric component and anisotropy, which\nultimately leads to a couple of relativistic models. In both cases, solving the\ndifferential equations result in the appearance of integration constants. By\nequating the Schwarzschild exterior metric and spherical interior line element\non the interface, these constants are explicitly obtained. The disappearance of\nthe radial pressure on the hypersurface is also used in this context. We\nfurther use estimated radii and masses of six different stars to graphically\nvisualize the physical properties of new solutions. Both of our models are\ndeduced to be well-aligned with all physical requirements, indicating the\nsuperiority of the presence of anisotropy in compact stellar interiors over the\nperfect isotropic fluid content."}

In the KernelBench setup,\nour model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing\nmodel, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel\ngeneration, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and\nClaude-4-sonnet.

It\nis shown that the symmetry group of gravitational theories on the Lyra geometry\ncomprises not only coordinate transformations but also local transformations of\nlength units, so that the Lyra function is the conformal factor which locally\nfixes the unit of length. By performing a Lyra transformation to a frame in\nwhich the unit of length is globally fixed, it is shown that General Relativity\nis obtained from the Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST). Through the same\nprocedure, even in the presence of matter fields, it is found that Brans-Dicke\ngravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory are obtained from\ntheir Lyra counterparts. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the\nMach-Dicke principle, since the strength of gravity in Brans-Dicke-Lyra is\ncontrolled by the scale function. It might be possible that any known\nscalar-tensor theory can be naturally geometrized by considering a particular\nLyra frame, for which the scalar field is the function which locally controls\nthe unit of length.

First, for Haar-almost every $U$, we show that\n$3\\log_{p}(1/\\varepsilon)$ $G$-count is both necessary and sufficient;\nmoreover, probabilistic synthesis improves the leading constant to $3/2$.\nSecond, for unitaries whose ratio of matrix elements lies in a specified number\nfield, $4\\log_p(1/\\varepsilon)$ $G$-count is necessary. Again, the leading\nconstant can be improved to $2$ by probabilistic synthesis.

To close the gap\nbetween the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,\ni.e., \\textit{R\\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\\'enyi\nentropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss\nHessian.

SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to\n$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \\ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity\ncomparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,\nreducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +\nd|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \\le |N_i|$ is the\naccepted neighbor count.

Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have\nreported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search\nbut also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\\times$ width multiplier for\nResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width\nensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance\nof finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,\neven without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for\nachieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration.

In\nparticular, approximate k-designs are random unitary ensembles that resemble\nrandom circuits up to their first k moments. It was recently shown that on n\nqudits, random circuits with slightly structured architectures converge to\nk-designs in depth O(log n), even on one-dimensional connectivity. It has\nhowever remained open whether the same shallow depth applies more generally\namong random circuit architectures and connectivities, or if the structure is\ntruly necessary. We recall the study of exponential relative entropy decay,\nanother topic with a long history in quantum information theory. We show that a\nconstant number of layers of a parallel random circuit on a family of\narchitectures including one-dimensional `brickwork' has O(1 / logn) per-layer\nmultiplicative entropy decay. We further show that on general connectivity\ngraphs of bounded degree, randomly placed gates achieve O(1 / nlogn)-decay\n(consistent with logn depth). Both of these results imply that random circuit\nensembles with O(polylog(n)) depth achieve approximate k-designs in diamond\nnorm. Hence our results address the question of whether extra structure is\ntruly necessary for sublinear-depth convergence. Furthermore, the relative\nentropy recombination techniques might be of independent interest."}

In this work, we model metastable states as\napproximate stationary states of a quasi-local, (KMS)-detailed-balanced master\nequation representing Markovian system-bath interaction, and unveil a universal\nstructural theory: all metastable states satisfy an area law of mutual\ninformation and a Markov property. The more metastable the states are, the\nlarger the regions to which these structural results apply. Therefore, the\nhallmark correlation structure and noise resilience of Gibbs states are not\nexclusive to true equilibrium but emerge dynamically. Behind our structural\nresults lies a systematic framework encompassing sharp equivalences between\nlocal minima of free energy, a non-commutative Fisher information, and\napproximate detailed balance conditions.

We prove these high energies can make computing properties of bosonic\ncomputations, such as deciding whether a given computation will attain infinite\nenergy, extremely difficult, formally undecidable.

For example,\ncertain gate sets allow poly-time bosonic computations to simulate PTOWER, the\nset of deterministic computations whose runtime scales as a tower of\nexponentials with polynomial height. Even just exponential energy and $O(1)$\nmodes suffice to simulate NP, which, importantly, is a setup similar to that of\nthe recent bosonic factoring algorithm of [Brenner, Caha, Coiteux-Roy and\nKoenig (2024)]. For simpler gate sets, we show an energy hierarchy theorem.
