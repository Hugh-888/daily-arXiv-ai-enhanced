Designed as a drop-in replacement for the linear algebra routines in existing R-matrix codes, HPRMAT employs direct linear equation solving with optimized libraries instead of traditional matrix inversion, achieving significant performance improvements. The package provides four solver backends: (1) double-precision LU factorization, (2) mixed-precision arithmetic with iterative refinement, (3) a Woodbury formula approach exploiting the kinetic-coupling matrix structure, and (4) GPU acceleration. Benchmark calculations demonstrate that the GPU solver achieves up to 9$\\times$ speedup over optimized CPU direct solvers, and 18$\\times$ over legacy inversion-based codes, for large matrices ($N=25600$). The mixed-precision strategy is particularly effective on consumer GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3090/4090), where single-precision throughput exceeds double-precision by a factor of 64:1; by performing factorization in single precision with iterative refinement, HPRMAT overcomes the poor FP64 performance of consumer hardware while maintaining double-precision accuracy. This makes large-scale CDCC and coupled-channel calculations accessible to researchers using standard desktop workstations, without requiring expensive data-center GPUs. CPU-only solvers provide 5--7$\\times$ speedup through optimized libraries and algorithmic improvements. All solvers maintain physics accuracy with relative errors below $10^{-5}$ in cross-section calculations, validated against Descouvemont's reference code (Comput.\\ Phys.\\ Commun.\\ 200, 199--219 (2016)). HPRMAT provides interfaces for Fortran, C, Python, and Julia."}

However, this task faces a fundamental challenge when the governing equations are unknown and observational data are sparse. System stiffness, the coupling of multiple time-scales, further exacerbates this problem and hinders long-term prediction. Existing methods fall short: purely data-driven methods demand massive datasets, whereas physics-aware approaches are constrained by their reliance on known equations and fine-grained time steps. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an equation-free learning framework, namely, the Stable Spectral Neural Operator (SSNO), for modeling stiff partial differential equation (PDE) systems based on limited data. Instead of encoding specific equation terms, SSNO embeds spectrally inspired structures in its architecture, yielding strong inductive biases for learning the underlying physics. It automatically learns local and global spatial interactions in the frequency domain, while handling system stiffness with a robust integrating factor time-stepping scheme. Demonstrated across multiple 2D and 3D benchmarks in Cartesian and spherical geometries, SSNO achieves prediction errors one to two orders of magnitude lower than leading models. Crucially, it shows remarkable data efficiency, requiring only very few (2--5) training trajectories for robust generalization to out-of-distribution conditions. This work offers a robust and generalizable approach to learning stiff spatiotemporal dynamics from limited data without explicit \\textit{a priori} knowledge of PDE terms."}

Although Shor's algorithm theoretically enables polynomial-time integer factorization, its real-world performance heavily depends on stringent conditions related to the period obtained via quantum phase estimation. Our generalized decomposition method relaxes these conditions by systematically exploiting arbitrary divisors of the obtained period, effectively broadening the applicability of each quantum execution. Extensive classical simulations were performed to empirically validate our approach, involving over one million test cases across integers ranging from 2 to 8 digits. The proposed method achieved near-perfect success rates, exceeding 99.998% for 7-digit numbers and 99.999% for 8-digit numbers, significantly surpassing traditional and recently improved variants of Shor's algorithm. Crucially, this improvement is achieved without compromising the algorithm's polynomial-time complexity and integrates seamlessly with existing quantum computational frameworks. Moreover, our method enhances the efficiency of quantum resource usage by minimizing unnecessary repetitions, making it particularly relevant for quantum cryptanalysis with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study thus provides both theoretical advancements and substantial practical benefits, contributing meaningfully to the field of quantum algorithm research and the broader field of quantum information processing."}

Existing datasets rely on human demonstrations, limiting scalability. A natural alternative is to synthesize data from strong CUAs, yet their rollouts are highly noisy, with incorrect or suboptimal actions consisting a large proportion of the steps, making naive imitation ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that transforms noisy rollouts into reliable supervision without human annotation. The core idea is step-level filtering, which evaluates actions individually to retain only correct steps, complemented by reasoning augmentation for improved planning. Using this pipeline, we construct WebSTAR, a dataset of 13.3K trajectories and 100K graded, reasoning-rich steps synthesized from OpenAI's computer-use-preview model. We train Qwen-2.5-VL-Instruct models (7B and 32B) on WebSTAR. On WebVoyager, our 7B model surpasses SoTA open-source CUA model UI-TARS-1.5-7B by more than 15% with only supervised finetuning. Building on step-level grading, we further create WebSCORE, a dataset of graded step-level actions, and train StepRM, a 7B multimodal reward model distilled from o4-mini, which matches its grading quality while being far more efficient to deploy at scale. Our results establish step-level filtering as a key principle for scalable CUA training and construct two new datasets (WebSTAR, WebSCORE) and a lightweight reward model (StepRM) as practical tools to advance robust and efficient CUAs."}

Given computably described pure states |a>, |b> and a time-dependent unitary U(t), define the hitting time as the infimum of t > 0 such that the fidelity between U(t)|a> and |b> reaches a fixed threshold (with infinity if the threshold is never reached). We prove that there is no total algorithm that outputs this hitting time for all inputs; equivalently, the total UHTP is undecidable via a reduction from the halting problem. Operationally, we show a no-go theorem: for any fixed accuracy parameters, there is no universal finite-resource protocol that, for all computably described inputs, correctly outputs the hitting time while obeying uniform finite upper bounds on observation time and on dissipation/work. The proofs use reversible computation embedded into unitary dynamics, a fixed-target beacon construction, and a continuous-time lifting via piecewise-constant Hamiltonians. Our results target systems capable of embedding universal computation and complement prior undecidability results such as spectral-gap and quantum-control reachability. We distinguish logical time (inside the equations) from physical/operational time (of preparation, evolution, measurement), and show that universal time-step selection is impossible in both senses."}

It is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that models meso-scale brain regions in each modality as an independent expert and employs two-level gating networks to learn subject-specific fusion weights. Beyond improving diagnostic performance, MREF-AD provides modality- and region-level insight into how structural and molecular imaging jointly contribute to disease diagnosis. Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), MREF-AD achieves state-of-the-art performance over baselines while providing enhanced interpretability of brain region-specific biomarker relevance, underscoring its utility as a general framework for adaptive and interpretable multimodal fusion in neuroimaging."}

Using long-term, numerical relativity simulations in spherical symmetry, we extract and analyze the frequency spectra of the radial oscillation modes of fermion-boson stars. Our simulations reveal that the fermionic and bosonic components synchronize through gravitational coupling, enriching their oscillation spectrum. This synchronization leads to new multi-state scalar configurations and reshapes the hierarchy of the neutron-star radial modes. We further propose a procedure to compute the values of the new dominant modes as a function of the bosonic mass, and discuss the implications for neutron-star physics and gravitational-wave astronomy."}

This network can be used as a generator solely or with a Generative Adversarial Network; however, KAN has a slower speed of learning than neural networks for the number of parameters.

MoB replaces learned gating networks with Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auctions, where experts compete for each data batch by bidding their true cost -- a principled combination of execution cost (predicted loss) and forgetting cost (Elastic Weight Consolidation penalty). This game-theoretic approach provides three key advantages: (1) {stateless routing that is immune to catastrophic forgetting, (2) \\textbf{truthful bidding} guaranteed by dominant-strategy incentive compatibility, and (3) emergent specialization without explicit task boundaries.

We employ this framework to analyze the reduced dynamics of a subsystem and to test whether local decoherence probes quantum chaos in many-body systems. Across paradigmatic spin chain models, we show that while the Choi echo captures key dynamical features, it also exhibits intrinsic limitations that, in certain regions of parameter space, restrict its ability to resolve the integrable-to-chaos transition at the level of spectral correlations. In particular, we demonstrate that local decoherence can spuriously signal quantum chaos in integrable regimes, tracing them to the inability of a strictly local probe to distinguish efficient coherent transport from genuinely scrambling dynamics. Our results show that local decoherence signals are controlled by the entanglement generated between the probe and its environment during the dynamics, rather than by spectral correlations, clarifying the practical scope of local dynamical diagnostics."}

Methods: Data from the MIMIC-IV v1.0 and eICU v2.0 databases were used for model development and evaluation. The training cohort consisted of abdominal surgery patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) after postoperative sepsis onset. We introduce a new RL-based framework: converting the discrete SOFA score to a continuous cxSOFA for more nuanced state and reward functions; Second, defining \"good\" or \"bad\" strategies based on cxSOFA by a stepwise manner; Third, proposing a Treatment Effect Comparison Matrix (TECM), analogous to a confusion matrix for classification tasks, to evaluate the treatment strategies. We applied different RL algorithms, Q-Learning, DQN, DDQN, BCQ and CQL to optimize the treatment and comprehensively evaluated the framework. Results: Among the AI-derived strategies, the cxSOFA-CQL model achieved the best performance, reducing mortality from 1.83% to 0.74% with the average hospital stay from 11.11 to 9.42 days. TECM demonstrated consistent outcomes across models, highlighting robustness.

Two complementary measures are introduced: the mutual information energy, a state-independent quantity inspired by Onicescu's information energy that captures the geometric overlap between joint eigenspaces within a context; and an operational measure based on commutator expectation values that reflects contextual behavior at the level of measurement outcomes. We establish a hierarchy of bounds connecting these measures to the Robertson uncertainty relation, including spectral, purity-corrected, and operator norm estimates. The framework is applied to the Klyachko-Can-Binicioğlu-Shumovsky (KCBS) scenario for spin-1 systems, where all quantities admit closed-form expressions. The Majorana-stellar representation furnishes a common geometric platform on which both the operational measure and the uncertainty products can be analyzed. For spin-1, this representation yields a three-dimensional Euclidean-like visualization of the Hilbert space in which, states lying on a plane exhibit maximum uncertainty for the observable along the perpendicular direction; simultaneous optimization across all KCBS contexts singles out a unique state on the symmetry axis. Notably, states achieving the optimal sum of uncertainty products exhibit vanishing operational contextuality, while states with substantial operational contextuality satisfy a nontrivial Robertson bound -- the two extremes are achieved by distinct quantum states."}

Our findings indicate that when test particles possess magnetic moments, applying an external magnetic field of appropriate strength can induce resonant precession of the angular momentum direction under the influence of gravitational waves.

Second, for mixed Gaussian states, we constructively demonstrate that the notion of a partner subsystem splits into two: a correlation partner, which contains all classical and quantum correlations and need not correspond to a single degree of freedom, and an entanglement partner, which is always at most single-mode.

However, extending classical methods such as policy iteration to this setting remains difficult; the output process is non-Markovian, making policy-improvement steps interdependent across stages. We introduce a new family of monotonically improving policy-iteration algorithms that alternate between single-stage output-based policy improvements and policy evaluations according to a prescribed periodic pattern. We show that this family admits optimal patterns that maximize a natural computational-efficiency index, and we identify the simplest pattern with minimal period. Building on this structure, we further develop a model-free variant that estimates values from data and learns memoryless policies directly. Across several POMDPs examples, our method achieves significant computational speedups over policy-gradient baselines and recent specialized algorithms in both model-based and model-free settings."}

In this work, we introduce the linear constraint-driven clipping framework, a class of scalable and efficient methods designed to enhance the efficacy of NN verifiers. Under this framework, we develop two novel algorithms that efficiently utilize linear constraints to 1) reduce portions of the input space that are either verified or irrelevant to a subproblem in the context of branch-and-bound, and 2) directly improve intermediate bounds throughout the network. The process novelly leverages linear constraints that often arise from bound propagation methods and is general enough to also incorporate constraints from other sources. It efficiently handles linear constraints using a specialized GPU procedure that can scale to large neural networks without the use of expensive external solvers. Our verification procedure, Clip-and-Verify, consistently tightens bounds across multiple benchmarks and can significantly reduce the number of subproblems handled during BaB. We show that our clipping algorithms can be integrated with BaB-based verifiers such as $α,β$-CROWN, utilizing either the split constraints in activation-space BaB or the output constraints that denote the unverified input space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure on a broad range of benchmarks where, in some instances, we witness a 96% reduction in the number of subproblems during branch-and-bound, and also achieve state-of-the-art verified accuracy across multiple benchmarks.

One demonstration of this non-singular behavior on horizon was provided by Fronsdal in 1959, by finding a global isometric embedding of the Schwarzschild metric into a six-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. Isometric embeddings for the Reissner-Nordström metric have also been constructed, but they only embed the region external to the inner horizon or in a single Eddington-Finkelstein patch. This paper presents a global isometric embedding for the maximally extended Reissner-Nordström spacetime into a nine-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. We present the solution in terms of explicit local four-dimensional coordinates, and also as a level-set of functions of the higher-dimensional embedding spacetime. While the Reissner-Nordström embedding presented has several similarities to the Fronsdal embedding of the Schwarzschild metric, the presence of the second horizon requires additional embedding coordinates and terms not found in the Fronsdal embedding, in order that the embedding is defined and finite on each horizon."}

In this work, we present the first systematic study of PLL methods for ECG diagnosis. We adapt nine PLL algorithms to multi-label ECG diagnosis and evaluate them using a diverse set of clinically motivated ambiguity generation strategies, capturing both unstructured (e.g., random) and structured ambiguities (e.g., cardiologist-derived similarities, treatment relationships, and diagnostic taxonomies). Our experiments on the PTB-XL and Chapman datasets demonstrate that PLL methods vary substantially in their robustness to different types and degrees of ambiguity. Through extensive analysis, we identify key limitations of current PLL approaches in clinical settings and outline future directions for developing robust and clinically aligned ambiguity-aware learning frameworks for ECG diagnosis."}

Genuine network multiparty entanglement (GNME) achieves a systematic resolution of this goal by analyzing whether a $k$-party state can be prepared by a quantum network consisting of $(k-1)$-partite resources. We develop tools to certify and quantify GNME, and benchmark them for GHZ, W and Dicke states. We then study the 1d transverse field Ising model, where we find a sharp peak of GNME near the critical phase transition, and rapid suppression elsewhere. Finite temperature leads to a faster death of GNME compared to GME. Furthermore, certain 2d quantum spin liquids do not have GNME in microscopic subregions while possessing strong GME.

Multi-objective Bayesian optimization is a promising solution for such expensive, black-box problems: it fits probabilistic surrogates and selects new designs via an acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation. In practice, it requires tailored choices of surrogate and acquisition that rarely transfer to the next problem, is myopic when multi-step planning is often required, and adds refitting overhead, particularly in parallel or time-sensitive loops. We present TAMO, a fully amortized, universal policy for multi-objective black-box optimization. TAMO uses a transformer architecture that operates across varying input and objective dimensions, enabling pretraining on diverse corpora and transfer to new problems without retraining: at test time, the pretrained model proposes the next design with a single forward pass. We pretrain the policy with reinforcement learning to maximize cumulative hypervolume improvement over full trajectories, conditioning on the entire query history to approximate the Pareto frontier. Across synthetic benchmarks and real tasks, TAMO produces fast proposals, reducing proposal time by 50-1000x versus alternatives while matching or improving Pareto quality under tight evaluation budgets. These results show that transformers can perform multi-objective optimization entirely in-context, eliminating per-task surrogate fitting and acquisition engineering, and open a path to foundation-style, plug-and-play optimizers for scientific discovery workflows."}

Then, we propose FairOBD (Fairness-regularized Online Balanced Descent), which reconciles the tension between minimizing the hitting cost, switching cost, and fairness cost. Concretely, FairOBD decomposes the long-term fairness cost into a sequence of online costs by introducing an auxiliary variable and then leverages the auxiliary variable to regularize the online actions for fair outcomes. Based on a new approach to account for switching costs, we prove that FairOBD offers a worst-case asymptotic competitive ratio against a novel benchmark -- the optimal offline algorithm with parameterized constraints -- by considering $T\\to\\infty$. Finally, we run trace-driven experiments of dynamic computing resource provisioning for socially responsible AI inference to empirically evaluate FairOBD, showing that FairOBD can effectively reduce the total fairness-regularized cost and better promote fair outcomes compared to existing baseline solutions."}

The evolution governed by the Liouville operator preserves many properties of full quantum dynamics, including the conservation of total population, energy, and purity, and has shown quantitative agreement with exact quantum results for the expectation values of many observables where direct comparisons are feasible. However, since the QCLE density matrix operator is obtained from the partial Wigner transform of the full quantum density matrix, its matrix elements can have negative values, implying that the diagonal matrix elements behave as pseudo-densities rather than densities of classical phase space. Here, we compare phase-space distributions generated by exact quantum dynamics with those produced by QCLE evolution from pure quantum initial states. We show that resonance effects in the off-diagonal matrix elements differ qualitatively, particularly for low-energy states. Furthermore, numerical and analytical results for low-dimensional models reveal that the QCLE can violate the positivity of marginal phase-space densities, a property that should hold at all times for any physical system. A perturbative analysis of a model system confirms that such violations arise generically. We also show that the violations of positivity of the marginal densities vanish as the initial energy of the system increases relative to the energy gap between subsystem states.

Dimensionality reduction techniques and autoencoders are powerful tools for extracting features, but they often struggle with such high-dimensional data. This paper presents an enhanced autoencoder framework that incorporates a clustering loss, based on the soft silhouette score, alongside a contrastive loss to improve the visualization and interpretability of ensemble datasets. First, EfficientNetV2 is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled portions of the scientific ensemble datasets. By jointly optimizing the reconstruction, clustering, and contrastive objectives, our method encourages similar data points to group together while separating distinct clusters in the latent space. UMAP is subsequently applied to this latent representation to produce 2D projections, which are evaluated using the silhouette score. Multiple types of autoencoders are evaluated and compared based on their ability to extract meaningful features. Experiments on two scientific ensemble datasets - channel structures in soil derived from Markov chain Monte Carlo, and droplet-on-film impact dynamics - show that models incorporating clustering or contrastive loss marginally outperform the baseline approaches."}

This research proposes a heterogeneous data pipeline that performs cross-domain data fusion over time-varying, spatial-varying and spatial-varying time-series datasets. We aim to address complex urban problems across multiple domains and localities by harnessing the rich information over 50 data sources. Specifically, our data-learning module integrates homophily from spatial-varying dataset into graph-learning, embedding information of various localities into models. We demonstrate the generalizability and flexibility of the framework through five real-world observations using a variety of publicly accessible datasets (e.g., ride-share, traffic crash, and crime reports) collected from multiple cities. The results show that our proposed framework demonstrates strong predictive performance while requiring minimal reconfiguration when transferred to new localities or domains. This research advances the goal of building data-informed urban systems in a scalable way, addressing one of the most pressing challenges in smart city analytics."}

We study this bandwidth-limited regime and show that naive dimensionality reduction consistently degrades coordination performance. Hard bandwidth constraints force selective encoding, but deterministic projections lack mechanisms to control how compression occurs. We introduce Bandwidth-constrained Variational Message Encoding (BVME), a lightweight module that treats messages as samples from learned Gaussian posteriors regularized via KL divergence to an uninformative prior. BVME's variational framework provides principled, tunable control over compression strength through interpretable hyperparameters, directly constraining the representations used for decision-making. Across SMACv1, SMACv2, and MPE benchmarks, BVME achieves comparable or superior performance while using 67--83% fewer message dimensions, with gains most pronounced on sparse graphs where message quality critically impacts coordination. Ablations reveal U-shaped sensitivity to bandwidth, with BVME excelling at extreme ratios while adding minimal overhead."}

The natural progression has been toward larger, more comprehensive and challenging collections of static problems, an approach that inadvertently constrains the kinds of advances we can measure and incentivize. To address this limitation, we argue for progress-oriented benchmarks, problem environments whose objectives are themselves the core targets of scientific progress, so that achieving state of the art on the benchmark advances the field. As a introductory step, we instantiate an environment based on the NanoGPT speedrun. The environment standardizes a dataset slice, a reference model and training harness, and rich telemetry, with run-time verification and anti-gaming checks. Evaluation centers on the scientific delta achieved: best-attained loss and the efficiency frontier. Using this environment, we achieve a new state-of-the-art training time, improving upon the previous record by 3 seconds, and qualitatively observe the emergence of novel algorithmic ideas. Moreover, comparisons between models and agents remain possible, but they are a means, not the end; the benchmark's purpose is to catalyze reusable improvements to the language modeling stack. With this release, the overarching goal is to seed a community shift from static problem leaderboards to test-time research on open-ended yet measurable scientific problems. In this new paradigm, progress on the benchmark is progress on the science, thus reframing \"benchmarking\" as a vehicle for scientific advancement."}

As an alternative, the Earth's magnetic field entails location information and is found critical to many animals' cognitive and navigation behavior. However, the practical use of the Earth's magnetic field for geo-localization hinges on an ultra-sensitive magnetometer. This work investigates how quantum magnetic sensing can be used for this purpose. We theoretically derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the estimation error of quantum sensing when using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and prove the quantum advantage over classical magnetometers. Moreover, we employ a practical distributed quantum sensing protocol to saturate CRLB. Based on the estimated magnetic field and the earth's magnetic field map, we formulate geo-localization as a map-matching problem and introduce a coarse-to-fine Mahalanobis distance search in both gradient space (local field derivatives) and corner space (raw field samples). We simulate the proposed quantum sensing-based geo-localization framework over four cities in the United States and Canada. The results report that in high-gradient regions, gradient-space Mahalanobis search achieves sub-kilometer median localization error; while in magnetically smoother areas, corner-space search provides better accuracy and a $4-8\\times$ reduction in runtime."}

Like any machine learning problem, the choice of activation function influences the characteristics and performance of the solution obtained from physics-informed training. Several studies have compared common activation functions on benchmark differential equations, and have unanimously found that the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is outperformed by competitors such as the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and swish activation functions. In this work, we diagnose the poor performance of ReLU on physics-informed machine learning problems. While it is well-known that the piecewise linear form of ReLU prevents it from being used on second-order differential equations, we show that ReLU fails even on variational problems involving only first derivatives. We identify the cause of this failure as second derivatives of the activation, which are taken not in the formulation of the loss, but in the process of training. Namely, we show that automatic differentiation in PyTorch fails to characterize derivatives of discontinuous fields, which causes the gradient of the physics-informed loss to be mis-specified, thus explaining the poor performance of ReLU."}

In this work, we show a fundamental limit for quantum state verification for all cut-and-choose approaches used to verify arbitrary quantum states. We provide a no-go result showing that the cut-and-choose techniques cannot lead to quantum state verification protocols that are both efficient in the number of rounds and secure.

While conventional dememorization techniques, such as regularization and data filtering, limit overfitting to specific training examples, they fail to systematically prevent the internalization of prohibited concept-level features. Simply discarding all images containing a sensitive feature wastes invaluable training data, necessitating a method for selective unlearning at the concept level.\n  To address this, we introduce a Gradient Projection Framework designed to enforce a stringent requirement of concept-level feature exclusion. Our defense operates during backpropagation by systematically identifying and excising training signals aligned with embeddings of prohibited attributes. Specifically, we project each gradient update onto the orthogonal complement of the sensitive feature's embedding space, thereby zeroing out its influence on the model's weights. Our method integrates seamlessly into standard diffusion model training pipelines and complements existing defenses. We analyze our method against an adversary aiming for feature extraction. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework drastically reduces memorization while rigorously preserving generation quality and semantic fidelity. By reframing memorization control as selective learning, our approach establishes a new paradigm for IP-safe and privacy-preserving generative AI."}

We investigate quantum machine learning for this task, focusing on Quantum Kernel Methods (QKMs) applied to real and complex SAR chips extracted from the SARFish dataset. We tackle two binary classification problems, the first for distinguishing vessels from non-vessels, and the second for distinguishing fishing vessels from other types of vessels. We compare QKMs applied to real and complex SAR chips against classical Laplacian, RBF, and linear kernels applied to real SAR chips.

By combining quantum speed limits with the mass energy equivalence of special relativity, we show that spatial localizability and temporal resolution are not independent: sharpening one inevitably blurs the other. Specifically, the internal energy coherence needed for precise timekeeping affects the center of mass dynamics, enhancing position spreading during free evolution. As a result, a single composite system cannot act as a perfect quantum reference frame for both space and time, leading to a Heisenberg like uncertainty relation between spatial and temporal intervals. After analyzing this trade off from an external perspective, we formulate it in a purely relational manner, by means of covariant observables relative to the space time quantum reference frame, uncovering an additional intrinsic uncertainty of order the Compton wavelength of the frame."}

We show that although selection can significantly complicate the joint distribution, interestingly, the ranks in the biased covariance matrices still preserve meaningful information about both causal structures and selection mechanisms. We provide a graph-theoretic characterization of such rank constraints.

In this paper, we explore these local encodings from the perspective of the corresponding time-evolution unitaries. Specifically, we propose a new framework for digital implementations of these qubit-encoded fermionic time-evolution unitaries based on \\emph{flow sets}, which are one-dimensional subsets of the directed fermionic interaction graph. We find that any local fermionic encoding, when restricted to a given flow set, adopts a simple structure that we can classify systematically. For each categorized flow-set form, we propose a low-depth qubit quantum circuit that implements the time evolution unitary using the stabilizer formalism. As an application of our construction, we introduce novel flow-based decompositions for known two-dimensional encodings, leading to efficient circuit decompositions of time-evolution unitaries. We generally observe a space-time trade-off, where mappings with larger qubit-to-fermion ratios yield shallower time-evolution quantum circuits."}

Under such double coupling, it is found that while the Hamiltonian of the system is clearly Hermitian the dynamics of the quadrature components of the field operators can be attributed to non-Hermicity of the system. It is manifested in an asymmetric coupling between the quadrature components which then leads to a variety of remarkable features. In particular, we identify how the emerging exceptional point controls the conversion of thermal states of the modes into single-mode classically or quantum squeezed states. Furthermore, for reservoirs being in squeezed states, we find that the two-photon correlations present in these reservoirs are responsible for unidirectional flow of populations and correlations among the modes and the flow can be controlled by appropriate tuning of the mutual orientation of the squeezed noise ellipses. In the course of analyzing these effects we find that the flow of the population creates the first-order coherence between the modes which, on the other hand rules out an enhancement of the two photon correlations responsible for entanglement between the modes. These results suggest new alternatives for the creation of single mode squeezed fields and the potential applications for controlled unidirectional transfer of population and correlations in bosonic chains."}

Leveraging known techniques, we describe an approach where multiple complex functions are encoded onto auxiliary qubits.

Adhering to the convolution theorem, we then demonstrate how the convolution $f*g$ can be constructed.

Here, we provide a simple generalisation of this result for (i) all sequence positions beyond the last, (ii) any transformer block beyond the first, and (iii) more realistic residual blocks including layer normalisation. We empirically verify our theory on simple in-context linear regression tasks and investigate the relationship between the implicit updates related to different tokens within and between blocks.

Their potential exposure to external world makes them susceptible to cyber-attacks. Existing detection methods against controller logic attacks use either specification-based or learnt models. However, specification-based models require experts' manual efforts or access to PLC's source code, while machine learning-based models often fall short of providing explanation for their decisions. We design SRLR -- a it Symbolic Regression based Logic Recovery} solution to identify the logic of a PLC based only on its inputs and outputs. The recovered logic is used to generate explainable rules for detecting controller logic attacks. SRLR enhances the latest deep symbolic regression methods using the following ICS-specific properties: (1) some important ICS control logic is best represented in frequency domain rather than time domain; (2) an ICS controller can operate in multiple modes, each using different logic, where mode switches usually do not happen frequently; (3) a robust controller usually filters out outlier inputs as ICS sensor data can be noisy; and (4) with the above factors captured, the degree of complexity of the formulas is reduced, making effective search possible. Thanks to these enhancements, SRLR consistently outperforms all existing methods in a variety of ICS settings that we evaluate. In terms of the recovery accuracy, SRLR's gain can be as high as 39% in some challenging environment. We also evaluate SRLR on a distribution grid containing hundreds of voltage regulators, demonstrating its stability in handling large-scale, complex systems with varied configurations."}

Quantum error correction (QEC) is vital for handling qubits, which are vulnerable to external noise. In QEC, actual errors are predicted from the results of syndrome measurements by stabilizer generators, in place of making direct measurements of the data qubits. Here, we propose Quantum Golay code Error Correction (QGEC), a QEC method using Golay code, which is an efficient coding method in classical information theory. We investigated our method's ability in decoding calculations with the Transformer. We evaluated the accuracy of the decoder in a code space defined by the generative polynomials with three different weights sets and three noise models with different correlations of bit-flip error and phase-flip error. Furthermore, under a noise model following a discrete uniform distribution, we compared the decoding performance of Transformer decoders with identical architectures trained respectively on Golay and toric codes. The results showed that the noise model with the smaller correlation gave better accuracy, while the weights of the generative polynomials had little effect on the accuracy of the decoder. In addition, they showed that Golay code requiring 23 data qubits and having a code distance of 7 achieved higher decoding accuracy than toric code which requiring 50 data qubits and having a code distance of 5. This suggests that implementing quantum error correction using a Transformer may enable the Golay code to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation more efficiently."}

Here, we show that even under perfect isolation, intrinsic unitary dynamics with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis suppress the observable signatures of macroscopic coherence. Using the GHZ state as a representative example, we demonstrate that while fully correlated measurements can initially distinguish a macroscopic superposition from its corresponding classical mixture, generic many-body evolution renders them operationally indistinguishable for most times during the evolution. By analyzing both distinguishability measures and established quantifiers of macroscopic quantumness, we find that equilibration not only hides coherence from accessible observables but also suppresses macroscopic superpositions themselves. These results identify unitary thermalization, independent of environmental decoherence, as a fundamental mechanism that limits the emergence of macroscopic quantum effects."}

Building on this theory, we introduce a principled symmetry-aware steering framework and compare standard, equivariant, and approximately equivariant RL strategies through comprehensive experiments across tasks with varying degrees of symmetry.

A major theoretical challenge is to construct dynamical models that are simultaneously consistent with classical thermodynamics and complete positivity. In this work, we develop a framework that addresses this issue by extending classical stochastic dynamics to the quantum domain. We begin by formulating a generalized Langevin equation in which both friction and noise act symmetrically on the two Hamiltonian equations. From this, we derive a generalized Klein-Kramers equation expressed in terms of Poisson brackets, and we show that it admits the Boltzmann distribution as its stationary solution while satisfying the first and second laws of thermodynamics along individual trajectories. Applying canonical quantization to this classical framework yields two distinct quantum master equations, depending on whether the friction operators are taken to be Hermitian or non-Hermitian. By analyzing the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, we determine the conditions under which these equations reduce to a Lindblad-type generator. Our results demonstrate that complete positivity is ensured only when friction and noise are included in both Hamiltonian equations, thus fully justifying the classical construction. Moreover, we find that the friction coefficients must satisfy the same positivity condition in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian formulations, revealing a form of universality that transcends the specific operator representation. The formalism offers a versatile tool for deriving quantum versions of the thermodynamic laws and is directly applicable to a wide class of nonequilibrium nanoscale systems."}

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for trust prediction, owing to their ability to learn expressive node representations that capture intricate trust relationships within a network. However, current GNN-based trust prediction models face several limitations: (i) Most of them fail to capture trust dynamicity, leading to questionable inferences. (ii) They rarely consider the heterogeneous nature of real-world networks, resulting in a loss of rich semantics. (iii) None of them support context-awareness, a basic property of trust, making prediction results coarse-grained.\n  To this end, we propose CAT, the first Context-Aware GNN-based Trust prediction model that supports trust dynamicity and accurately represents real-world heterogeneity. CAT consists of a graph construction layer, an embedding layer, a heterogeneous attention layer, and a prediction layer. It handles dynamic graphs using continuous-time representations and captures temporal information through a time encoding function. To model graph heterogeneity and leverage semantic information, CAT employs a dual attention mechanism that identifies the importance of different node types and nodes within each type. For context-awareness, we introduce a new notion of meta-paths to extract contextual features. By constructing context embeddings and integrating a context-aware aggregator, CAT can predict both context-aware trust and overall trust. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CAT outperforms five groups of baselines in trust prediction, while exhibiting strong scalability to large-scale graphs and robustness against both trust-oriented and GNN-oriented attacks."}

Here, we improve these limits by providing a tight bound for this crucial parameter, which shows a linear dependence with the number of couplings. This result enables a precise estimation of the time resources needed for quantum simulations and quantum algorithms implemented within the DAQC framework, facilitating a rigorous comparison with other approaches."}

In this work, we extend the concept of adversarial graphs to the community detection problem, which is more challenging. We propose novel attack and defense techniques for community detection problem, with the objective of hiding targeted individuals from detection models and enhancing the robustness of community detection models, respectively. These techniques have many applications in real-world scenarios, for example, protecting personal privacy in social networks and understanding camouflage patterns in transaction networks. To simulate interactive attack and defense behaviors, we further propose a game-theoretic framework, called CD-GAME. One player is a graph attacker, while the other player is a Rayleigh Quotient defender. The CD-GAME models the mutual influence and feedback mechanisms between the attacker and the defender, revealing the dynamic evolutionary process of the game. Both players dynamically update their strategies until they reach the Nash equilibrium. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack and defense methods, and both outperform existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, CD-GAME provides valuable insights for understanding interactive attack and defense scenarios in community detection problems. We found that in traditional single-step attack or defense, attacker tends to employ strategies that are most effective, but are easily detected and countered by defender. When the interactive game reaches a Nash equilibrium, attacker adopts more imperceptible strategies that can still achieve satisfactory attack effectiveness even after defense."}

Our MLOps pipeline employs multi-criteria statistical techniques to detect distribution shifts and triggers model updates only when necessary, ensuring computational efficiency and resource optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on several benchmark anomaly detection data sets, showing significant improvements in model accuracy and robustness compared to traditional retraining strategies. Our work provides a foundation for deploying more reliable and adaptive ML systems in dynamic real-world settings, where data distribution changes are common."}

However, raw sensor streams are often imbalanced and contain significant redundancy, meaning that not all data points contribute equally to model generalization. In this paper, we show that, in some cases, \"less is more\" when considering datasets. We do this by reframing the data selection problem: rather than tuning model hyperparameters, we fix the model and optimize the composition of the training data itself. We introduce a framework for discovering the optimal \"training diet\" from a large, unlabeled time series corpus. Our framework first uses a large-scale encoder and k-means clustering to partition the dataset into distinct, behaviorally consistent clusters. These clusters represent the fundamental 'ingredients' available for training. We then employ the Optuna optimization framework to search the high-dimensional space of possible data mixtures. For each trial, Optuna proposes a specific sampling ratio for each cluster, and a new training set is constructed based on this recipe. A smaller target model is then trained and evaluated. Our experiments reveal that this data-centric search consistently discovers data mixtures that yield models with significantly higher performance compared to baselines trained on the entire dataset. Specifically - evaluated on PMSM dataset - our method improved performance from a baseline MSE of 1.70 to 1.37, a 19.41% improvement."}

MKL seeks an optimal linear combination of base kernels that maximizes a generalized performance measure under a regularization constraint. Various norms have been used to regularize the kernel weights, including $l1$, $l2$ and $lp$, as well as the \"elastic-net\" penalty, which combines $l1$- and $l2$-norm to promote both sparsity and the selection of correlated kernels. This property makes elastic-net regularized MKL (ENMKL) especially valuable when model interpretability is critical and kernels capture correlated information, such as in neuroimaging. Previous ENMKL methods have followed a two-stage procedure: fix kernel weights, train a support vector machine (SVM) with the weighted kernel, and then update the weights via gradient descent, cutting-plane methods, or surrogate functions. Here, we introduce an alternative ENMKL formulation that yields a simple analytical update for the kernel weights. We derive explicit algorithms for both SVM and kernel ridge regression (KRR) under this framework, and implement them in the open-source Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo). We evaluate these ENMKL algorithms against $l1$-norm MKL and against SVM (or KRR) trained on the unweighted sum of kernels across three neuroimaging applications. Our results show that ENMKL matches or outperforms $l1$-norm MKL in all tasks and only underperforms standard SVM in one scenario.

Conventional methods such as the Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction scale exponentially with molecular size, limiting their applicability to large molecules. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative by mapping molecular Hamiltonians by qubits, enabling cheaper computational scaling. Previous studies have shown that it is possible to formulate molecular ground state calculations as discrete optimization problems, addressable by quantum annealing. However, these efforts have been limited by previous generations of hardware and suboptimal annealing techniques. Here, the $H_{2}O$ ground-state problem is mapped to an Ising Hamiltonian using the Xian-Bias-Kas (XBK) method. By taking advantage of enhanced qubit connectivity and shorter embedding chains, it is solved with a more than doubled probability of achieving Hartree-Fock-level solutions with respect to the most advanced predecessor. Advanced annealing strategies extend Hartree-Fock-level accuracy to significantly larger problem instances, enabling solutions that use nearly 2.5 times more physically embedded qubits than the largest cases previously reported and allowing to improve annealing results by two orders of magnitude, reaching an energy difference of 0.120~Hartree relative to Hartree-Fock.

This reduction yields significantly simpler algorithmic steps, which we analyze using classical linear algebra tools. Using these tools, we demonstrate on a minimalistic example that the nonlinearity in a two-layer model can provably yield a faster iteration complexity $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{d})$ compared to $Ω(d)$ achieved by linear models, where $d$ is the number of features.

However, existing research communities address these challenges in isolation. Continual Learning (CL) focuses on long-term retention and mitigating catastrophic forgetting, often without strict real-time constraints. Stream Learning (SL) emphasizes rapid, efficient adaptation to high-frequency data streams, but typically neglects forgetting. Recent efforts have tried to combine these paradigms, yet no clear algorithmic overlap exists. We argue that large in-context tabular models (LTMs) provide a natural bridge for Streaming Continual Learning (SCL). In our view, unbounded streams should be summarized on-the-fly into compact sketches that can be consumed by LTMs. This recovers the classical SL motivation of compressing massive streams with fixed-size guarantees, while simultaneously aligning with the experience-replay desiderata of CL. To clarify this bridge, we show how the SL and CL communities implicitly adopt a divide-to-conquer strategy to manage the tension between plasticity (performing well on the current distribution) and stability (retaining past knowledge), while also imposing a minimal complexity constraint that motivates diversification (avoiding redundancy in what is stored) and retrieval (re-prioritizing past information when needed). Within this perspective, we propose structuring SCL with LTMs around two core principles of data selection for in-context learning: (1) distribution matching, which balances plasticity and stability, and (2) distribution compression, which controls memory size through diversification and retrieval mechanisms."}

However, the current primary approach to building Krylov vectors in these algorithms is to use real or imaginary-time evolution, which is not exact, require an arbitrary time-step parameter ($Δt$), and degrade the Krylov vectors quickly with increasing $Δt$. In this paper, we develop a quantum Krylov algorithm without time evolution and with an exact formulation of the Krylov subspace, named ``Quantum Krylov using Unitary Decomposition'' (QKUD), along with implementation proposals for quantum computers. Not only is this algorithm exact in the limit $ε\\to 0$ of the error parameter $ε$, but it also produces more accurate Krylov vectors at $ε\\neq 0$ than conventional time evolution due to more favorable error scaling (O($ε^2$) vs O($Δt$)).

Bayesian optimization, a widely used black-box and sample-efficient learning method, constructs a probabilistic surrogate of the closed-loop performance from few experiments and uses it to select informative controller parameters. However, it typically struggles with dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations, as they may appear, for example, in tuning model predictive controllers, because standard surrogate models fail to capture the structure of such spaces. This work suggests that the use of Bayesian neural networks as surrogate models may help to mitigate this limitation. Through a comparison between Gaussian processes with Matern kernels, finite-width Bayesian neural networks, and infinite-width Bayesian neural networks on a cart-pole task, we find that Bayesian neural network surrogate models achieve faster and more reliable convergence of the closed-loop cost and enable successful optimization of parameterizations with hundreds of dimensions. Infinite-width Bayesian neural networks also maintain performance in settings with more than one thousand parameters, whereas Matern-kernel Gaussian processes rapidly lose effectiveness.

The core insight is that benign optimization trajectories, despite per-client heterogeneity, concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold that can be estimated from historical aggregates. SpectralKrum projects incoming updates into this learned subspace, applies Krum selection in compressed coordinates, and filters candidates whose orthogonal residual energy exceeds a data-driven threshold.

Here, we propose Quantum Golay code Error Correction (QGEC), a QEC method using Golay code, which is an efficient coding method in classical information theory. We investigated our method's ability in decoding calculations with the Transformer. We evaluated the accuracy of the decoder in a code space defined by the generative polynomials with three different weights sets and three noise models with different correlations of bit-flip error and phase-flip error. Furthermore, under a noise model following a discrete uniform distribution, we compared the decoding performance of Transformer decoders with identical architectures trained respectively on Golay and toric codes. The results showed that the noise model with the smaller correlation gave better accuracy, while the weights of the generative polynomials had little effect on the accuracy of the decoder. In addition, they showed that Golay code requiring 23 data qubits and having a code distance of 7 achieved higher decoding accuracy than toric code which requiring 50 data qubits and having a code distance of 5. This suggests that implementing quantum error correction using a Transformer may enable the Golay code to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation more efficiently."}

We propose the Adaptive Vekua Cascade (AVC), a hybrid architecture that bridges deep learning and classical approximation theory. AVC decouples manifold learning from function approximation by using a deep network to learn a diffeomorphic warping of the physical domain, projecting complex spatiotemporal dynamics onto a latent manifold where the solution is represented by a basis of generalized analytic functions. Crucially, we replace the standard gradient-descent output layer with a differentiable linear solver, allowing the network to optimally resolve spectral coefficients in a closed form during the forward pass. We evaluate AVC on a suite of five rigorous physics benchmarks, including high-frequency Helmholtz wave propagation, sparse medical reconstruction, and unsteady 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence. Our results demonstrate that AVC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing parameter counts by orders of magnitude (e.g., 840 parameters vs. 4.2 million for 3D grids) and converging 2-3x faster than implicit neural representations. This work establishes a new paradigm for memory-efficient, spectrally accurate scientific machine learning. The code is available at https://github.com/VladimerKhasia/vecua."}

We develop a unified, measure-based framework for studying single-layer softmax attention under both finite and infinite prompts. For i.i.d. Gaussian inputs, we lean on the fact that the softmax operator converges in the infinite-prompt limit to a linear operator acting on the underlying input-token measure. Building on this insight, we establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the output and gradient of softmax attention, quantifying how rapidly the finite-prompt model approaches its infinite-prompt counterpart, and prove that this concentration remains stable along the entire training trajectory in general in-context learning settings with sub-Gaussian tokens. In the case of in-context linear regression, we use the tractable infinite-prompt dynamics to analyze training at finite prompt length. Our results allow optimization analyses developed for linear attention to transfer directly to softmax attention when prompts are sufficiently long, showing that large-prompt softmax attention inherits the analytical structure of its linear counterpart. This, in turn, provides a principled and broadly applicable toolkit for studying the training dynamics and statistical behavior of softmax attention layers in large prompt regimes."}

We present a simple geometric method for discovering interactions and redundancies: when elements are added in random sequential orders and their contributions plotted over many trials, characteristic L-shaped patterns emerge that directly reflect interaction structure. The approach quantifies how the contribution of each element depends on those added before it, revealing patterns that distinguish interaction, independence, and redundancy on a unified scale. When pairwise contributions are visualized as two--dimensional point clouds, redundant pairs form L--shaped patterns where only the first-added element contributes, while synergistic pairs form L--shaped patterns where only elements contribute together. Independent elements show order--invariant distributions. We formalize this with the L--score, a continuous measure ranging from $-1$ (perfect synergy, e.g. $Y=X_1X_2$) to $0$ (independence) to $+1$ (perfect redundancy, $X_1 \\approx X_2$). The relative scaling of the L--shaped arms reveals feature dominance in which element consistently provides more information. Although computed only from pairwise measurements, higher--order interactions among three or more elements emerge naturally through consistent cross--pair relationships (e.g. AB, AC, BC). The method is metric--agnostic and broadly applicable to any domain where performance can be evaluated incrementally over non-repeating element sequences, providing a unified geometric approach to uncovering interaction structure."}

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides reliable maritime surveillance under all weather and lighting conditions, but classifying small maritime objects in SAR imagery remains challenging. We investigate quantum machine learning for this task, focusing on Quantum Kernel Methods (QKMs) applied to real and complex SAR chips extracted from the SARFish dataset. We tackle two binary classification problems, the first for distinguishing vessels from non-vessels, and the second for distinguishing fishing vessels from other types of vessels. We compare QKMs applied to real and complex SAR chips against classical Laplacian, RBF, and linear kernels applied to real SAR chips. Using noiseless numerical simulations of the quantum kernels, we find that QKMs are capable of obtaining equal or better performance than the classical kernel on these tasks in the best case, but do not demonstrate a clear advantage for the complex SAR data. This work presents the first application of QKMs to maritime classification in SAR imagery and offers insight into the potential and current limitations of quantum-enhanced learning for maritime surveillance."}

However, this task faces a fundamental challenge when the governing equations are unknown and observational data are sparse. System stiffness, the coupling of multiple time-scales, further exacerbates this problem and hinders long-term prediction. Existing methods fall short: purely data-driven methods demand massive datasets, whereas physics-aware approaches are constrained by their reliance on known equations and fine-grained time steps. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an equation-free learning framework, namely, the Stable Spectral Neural Operator (SSNO), for modeling stiff partial differential equation (PDE) systems based on limited data. Instead of encoding specific equation terms, SSNO embeds spectrally inspired structures in its architecture, yielding strong inductive biases for learning the underlying physics. It automatically learns local and global spatial interactions in the frequency domain, while handling system stiffness with a robust integrating factor time-stepping scheme. Demonstrated across multiple 2D and 3D benchmarks in Cartesian and spherical geometries, SSNO achieves prediction errors one to two orders of magnitude lower than leading models. Crucially, it shows remarkable data efficiency, requiring only very few (2--5) training trajectories for robust generalization to out-of-distribution conditions. This work offers a robust and generalizable approach to learning stiff spatiotemporal dynamics from limited data without explicit \\textit{a priori} knowledge of PDE terms."}

We demonstrate the use of the trained decoder as a differentiable variational ansatz to minimize energy directly within the latent space. Crucially, this approach circumvents the $N$-representability problem, as the learned manifold implicitly restricts the optimization to physically valid quantum states."}
