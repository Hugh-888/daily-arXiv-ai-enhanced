### [1] [Uncovering Implicit Bias in Large Language Models with Concept Learning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01219)
*Leroy Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过上下文概念学习实验发现，语言模型在量词理解上存在向上单调性偏好，这种偏见在直接提示测试中不明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示大型语言模型中存在的隐性偏见，特别是通过概念学习任务来发现那些在直接测试中不易察觉的偏见。

Method: 使用上下文概念学习实验，比较模型在概念学习任务和直接提示测试中的表现差异。

Result: 语言模型在量词理解上表现出向上单调性偏好，这种偏见在概念学习任务中更明显，而在直接提示测试中较不明显。

Conclusion: 上下文概念学习是发现语言模型中隐藏偏见的有效方法。

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

### [2] [Towards Open-Ended Discovery for Low-Resource NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01220)
*Bonaventure F. P. Dossou,Henri Aïdasso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张从静态数据收集转向交互式语言发现范式，通过人机对话动态学习低资源语言，结合模型认知不确定性和人类犹豫信号来指导交互学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言NLP面临的文本语料匮乏、标准化拼写缺失和可扩展标注流程不足等根本限制，让AI系统能够为代表性不足的语言社区提供可访问的语言技术支持。

Method: 提出基于联合人机不确定性的框架，结合模型的认知不确定性和人类说话者的犹豫线索与置信信号，指导交互、查询选择和记忆保留。

Result: 这是一个概念性框架，旨在推动从提取式数据收集向参与式、共同适应的学习过程转变，强调人机协作的交互式模型构建。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新思考AI如何与人类知识在未充分记录的语言中互动，转向尊重和赋能社区、同时发现和保护世界语言多样性的参与式学习过程。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

### [3] [Discourse vs emissions: Analysis of corporate narratives, symbolic practices, and mimicry through LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01222)
*Bertrand Kian Hassani,Yacoub Bahini,Rizwan Mushtaq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型分析828家美国上市公司气候披露成熟度，发现风险叙事与承诺相关但量化目标脱节，大公司披露更多但目标不一致，披露风格趋同降低决策有用性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化增加了对企业气候披露透明度和可比性的需求，但模仿性和象征性报告削弱了其价值

Method: 开发多维框架，使用微调的大型语言模型从可持续发展和年度报告中提取情感、承诺、具体性和目标雄心四个维度的叙事指标，并与企业属性关联分析

Result: 风险叙事与明确承诺相关但量化目标与语气脱节；大公司和高排放公司披露更多承诺和行动但目标不一致；披露风格广泛相似表明模仿行为

Conclusion: LLM在ESG叙事分析中具有价值，需要更强监管将承诺与可验证的转型策略联系起来

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

### [4] [Context Matters: Comparison of commercial large language tools in veterinary medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01224)
*Tyler J Poore,Christopher J Pinard,Aleena Shabbir,Andrew Lagree,Andre Telfer,Kuan-Chuen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估三种兽医专用LLM总结工具在肿瘤记录上的表现，发现Product 1（Hachiko）在准确性、完整性和组织性方面表现最佳，并验证了LLM作为评判者的可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在临床应用中日益普及，但在兽医医学领域的性能尚未充分探索，需要评估兽医专用LLM工具的实际表现。

Method: 使用标准化兽医肿瘤记录数据集，通过基于评分标准的LLM作为评判者框架，对三种商业兽医LLM总结工具在五个维度进行评分。

Result: Product 1表现最优，中位平均得分4.61，在事实准确性和时间顺序方面获得满分；LLM评分框架显示出高可重复性，标准差分别为0.015、0.088和0.034。

Conclusion: 兽医专用商业LLM工具的重要性得到证实，LLM作为评判者的评估方法是兽医医学临床NLP总结评估的可扩展且可重复的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

### [5] [ClaimCheck: Real-Time Fact-Checking with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01226)
*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck是一个基于小语言模型的自动事实核查系统，通过模块化流水线设计实现高效的事实核查，在AVeriTeC数据集上达到76.4%的准确率，超越了使用更大模型的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统依赖大型闭源模型和静态知识库，缺乏透明度和可解释性，且计算成本高昂。

Method: 采用模块化验证流水线，包括Web搜索查询规划、证据检索与总结、证据合成与再检索、声明裁决评估，每个模块都针对小语言模型优化。

Result: 使用仅4B参数的Qwen3模型，在AVeriTeC数据集上达到76.4%的准确率，超越了使用LLaMA3.1 70B和GPT-4o的先前方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的模块化架构和提示策略可以克服小语言模型的限制，实现高效、准确且可解释的事实核查，同时大幅降低计算需求。

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

### [6] [EEFSUVA: A New Mathematical Olympiad Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01227)
*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文质疑当前数学基准测试对LLM推理能力的夸大评估，并提出了EEFSUVA新基准来更全面地评估数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于IMO等知名竞赛的数学基准可能存在数据污染和问题类型单一的问题，导致对LLM数学推理能力的评估不够准确。

Method: 构建EEFSUVA基准，从东欧和前苏联国家的区域性奥数竞赛中选取题目，这些题目难度与IMO相当但更少出现在在线语料库中。

Result: 初步结果显示，即使是当前最先进的LLM在EEFSUVA基准上的表现也明显低于其他奥数风格基准。

Conclusion: 需要更广泛的评估数据集来全面评估数学推理能力，并指导未来模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [7] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型在处理系统提示与用户输入的层级指令时存在脆弱性，更倾向于服从社会线索而非系统指令，需要轻量级的层级敏感对齐方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型应该遵循层级指令（系统提示优先于用户输入），但近期研究表明它们经常忽略这一规则，而强烈服从权威或共识等社会线索。

Method: 使用线性探测分析冲突决策信号的编码位置，通过直接对数归因揭示内部冲突检测机制，并进行向量引导实验验证行为模式。

Result: 系统-用户冲突和社会冲突形成不同的子空间；系统-用户冲突检测更强但只有社会线索能一致解决；社会线索向量意外地以角色无关方式增强指令遵循。

Conclusion: 这些结果解释了系统服从的脆弱性，并强调了需要开发轻量级的层级敏感对齐方法。

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

### [8] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Rerankers with Synthetic Data and LLM-Based Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01229)
*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种无需人工标注数据的文档重排序方法，使用LLM生成合成查询并标注正负样本对，然后通过对比学习微调小型transformer模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在文档重排序中表现优异但计算成本高，微调小型模型需要大量人工标注数据，这在现实中难以获取。

Method: 使用LLM从领域语料生成合成查询，用LLM分类器标注正负样本对，构建合成数据集，然后用LCE损失函数通过对比学习微调小型transformer模型。

Result: 在MedQuAD数据集上实验表明，该方法显著提升领域内性能，并在领域外任务上具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM用于数据生成和监督而非推理，可以在降低计算成本的同时保持强大的重排序能力。

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

### [9] [Geometric Structures and Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Chinese Character Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01230)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用PHATE流形分析系统研究汉字嵌入中的几何模式，发现实词呈现聚类模式，虚词呈现分支模式，几何复杂度与语义内容相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究汉字嵌入中的几何模式，为传统语言学理论提供计算证据，建立语义组织的几何分析框架。

Method: 使用PHATE流形分析，交叉验证7个嵌入模型和8个降维方法，分析1000多个汉字在12个语义域中的分布，进行123个短语的子网络分析。

Result: 实词呈现聚类模式，虚词呈现分支模式；有意义的字符展现丰富的几何多样性，结构部首聚集成紧密簇；子网络分析显示从基本字符到短语的系统性语义扩展。

Conclusion: 几何复杂度与语义内容相关，为传统语言学理论提供计算支持，建立了语义组织几何分析的新框架。

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

### [10] [Trustworthy Summarization via Uncertainty Quantification and Risk Awareness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01231)
*Shuaidong Pan,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个集成不确定性量化和风险感知机制的大语言模型框架，用于提高高风险场景下自动摘要的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高风险场景中自动摘要的可靠性问题，应对信息过载和高风险决策的需求。

Method: 构建基于条件生成的摘要模型，引入贝叶斯推理建模参数空间不确定性，使用预测分布熵衡量生成内容的不确定性，结合熵正则化和风险感知损失进行联合优化，并加入风险评分和调控模块。

Result: 比较实验和敏感性分析验证该方法显著提高了高风险应用中摘要的鲁棒性和可靠性，同时保持了流畅性和语义完整性。

Conclusion: 为可信摘要提供了系统性解决方案，在方法论层面展示了可扩展性和实用价值。

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

### [11] [Benchmark Profiling: Mechanistic Diagnosis of LLM Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01232)
*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Benchmark Profiling框架，通过分解基准测试表现到10种认知能力，揭示了大多数基准测试实际依赖多种能力而非单一能力，解释了为什么性能提升不总是转化为用户感知的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在标准基准测试上的得分往往高估了真实能力，因为这些得分掩盖了任务实际需要的技能组合。缺乏系统方法来验证基准测试是否真正测量了它们声称的能力标签。

Method: 结合基于梯度的重要性评分和针对性参数消融，计算能力影响分数(AIS)来量化每种能力对模型在特定基准测试上成功的贡献程度。

Result: 分析三个指令调优模型在十个广泛使用的基准测试上发现：大多数基准测试依赖多种能力；相似标签的数据集依赖不同的能力组合；代码生成基准测试需要广泛的多技能改进；与任务无关的能力可能负面影响性能。

Conclusion: Benchmark Profiling解释了为什么性能提升不总是转化为用户感知的能力，并为基准测试审计和模型可解释性提供了透明工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

Conclusion: 展示了计算社会科学如何保护濒危文化知识系统，同时为文学遗产创造新的集体智能形式，为文化保护提供了社区中心方法的见解。

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

### [13] [LLMRank: Understanding LLM Strengths for Model Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01234)
*Shubham Agrawal,Prasang Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMRank是一个提示感知的路由框架，通过提取任务类型、推理模式、复杂度指标等可解释特征，使用神经排序模型预测每个模型的效用，实现LLM的智能路由选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在能力、延迟和计算成本上的多样性给部署带来了挑战：需要为每个提示选择最合适的模型来优化性能与效率的权衡。

Method: 利用从提示中提取的丰富、人类可读特征（任务类型、推理模式、复杂度指标、语法线索等），结合轻量级代理求解器的信号，使用在RouterBench上训练的神经排序模型预测每个模型的效用。

Result: 在包含36,497个提示、11个基准测试和11个最先进LLM的数据集上，该方法达到了89.2%的oracle效用，同时提供可解释的特征归因来解释路由决策。

Conclusion: 多方面的特征提取和混合排序目标的重要性得到验证，特征驱动的路由为高效透明的LLM部署展现了潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

### [14] [GRPO++: Enhancing Dermatological Reasoning under Low Resource Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01236)
*Ismam Nur Swapnil,Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DermIQ-VLM，一种通过多阶段资源高效方法开发的视觉语言模型，用于模拟皮肤科医生的诊断过程。主要贡献是改进的GRPO++算法，稳定了数据密集的GRPO框架，并结合DPO进行事实对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在皮肤病学等复杂领域中结构化推理能力受限的问题，主要挑战包括数据稀缺和高级训练技术的高计算成本。

Method: 采用多阶段训练流程：首先使用GRPO++进行推理导向的疾病识别，然后进行监督微调以获得对话能力，最后使用基于知识图谱的DPO进行事实对齐。

Result: 在精心策划的皮肤病数据集上的初步评估显示，该方法相比标准微调方法获得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 验证了该流程作为在资源受限环境中开发专业化、可靠视觉语言模型的可行途径的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

### [15] [Confidence-Aware Routing for Large Language Model Reliability Enhancement: A Multi-Signal Approach to Pre-Generation Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01237)
*Nandakishor M*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于置信度感知的路由系统，在生成前主动评估模型不确定性，根据可靠性估计重定向查询，显著减少大语言模型的幻觉问题并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉问题，生成看似合理但事实错误的内容。现有的后生成修正方法计算成本高且无法阻止不可靠内容的生成。

Method: 结合三种互补信号：内部表示与参考嵌入的语义对齐、跨模型层的内部收敛分析、学习置信度估计。统一置信度分数决定四个路由路径：高置信度本地生成、中置信度检索增强生成、低置信度使用更大模型、极低置信度人工审核。

Result: 在知识密集型QA基准测试中，幻觉检测显著改善（0.74 vs 0.42基线），计算成本比后处理方法降低40%。F1分数从0.61提升到0.82，假阳性率低至0.09。

Conclusion: 从反应性修正转向主动评估的范式转变，为大语言模型可靠性增强提供了计算效率高的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Yonatan Belinkov,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现填充标记（padding tokens）在大型语言模型中并非无害，即使少量填充也会影响模型激活、生成质量、偏见和安全防护，构成部署风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填充标记在批处理推理中被广泛使用，但实现错误可能导致它们影响计算，这种影响程度尚未被充分理解。

Method: 在三个开源模型家族（Llama、Gemma、Qwen）中系统研究填充影响，通过插入控制量的填充并评估激活、生成质量、偏见和安全四个维度。

Result: 即使少量填充也会改变隐藏表示，降低较小模型的质量，以不可预测的方式改变偏见，并削弱安全防护机制。

Conclusion: 填充不是无害的细节，而是部署中必须谨慎处理的鲁棒性风险。

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

### [17] [CIFLEX: Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution in Multi-Turn Interactions with a Single On-Device LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01239)
*Juntae Lee,Jihwan Bang,Seunghan Yang,Simyung Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIFLEX是一个用于在单设备大语言模型中高效处理多轮交互子任务的执行系统，通过重用主任务的KV缓存和注入任务特定指令来减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力增强，单个模型需要处理更多子任务来全面支持用户请求，但传统方法在切换主任务和子任务时需要重新处理整个对话上下文，产生显著计算开销。

Method: 通过重用主任务的KV缓存，在隔离的侧路径中注入任务特定指令，子任务执行后通过缓存上下文回滚到主路径，避免冗余预填充计算；同时开发了针对小规模模型的分层分类策略来支持子任务选择。

Result: 实验表明CIFLEX显著降低了计算成本，同时不降低任务性能，实现了可扩展和高效的设备端多任务对话。

Conclusion: CIFLEX通过创新的上下文指令流和KV缓存重用机制，有效解决了多任务对话中的计算效率问题，为设备端LLM应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了两个互补的数学基准：SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH（100项结构化诊断集）和SKYLENAGE-MATH（150项竞赛风格套件），用于评估LLMs在数学推理方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准存在天花板效应，需要更难的、以推理为中心的数学基准，具有校准难度和丰富元数据。

Method: 创建了两个基准：1）100项结构化诊断集，包含长度、数字密度和符号复杂性元数据；2）150项竞赛风格套件，涵盖从高中到博士四个阶段和七个学科分类。评估了15个当代LLM变体。

Result: 在竞赛套件中，最强模型达到44%准确率，次优模型37%；准确率从高中到博士阶段下降，顶级系统的博士到高中保留率约为79%。在推理集中，最佳模型总体达到81%，最难子集结果揭示了领先者与中游系统之间的明显稳健性差距。

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE提供了一个困难、以推理为中心且广泛覆盖的数学基准，具有校准难度和丰富元数据，可作为未来数学推理评估的参考基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a
reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

### [19] [Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

*Yisong Xiao,Aishan Liu,Siyuan Liang,Zonghao Ying,Xianglong Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARGRE是一种新颖的测试时去毒框架，通过在潜在表示空间中建模毒性转换，实现稳定精确的奖励引导编辑，显著降低LLM毒性输出同时保持模型核心能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM去毒方法由于对毒性和非毒性输出之间转换空间探索不足，导致干预不精确，需要更有效的测试时去毒策略。

Method: ARGRE识别非毒性语义方向，在毒性和非毒性表示之间插值以揭示细粒度转换轨迹，构建自回归奖励模型指导自适应两步编辑过程。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的LLM上实验表明，ARGRE在有效性（毒性降低62.21%）和效率（推理时间减少47.58%）上显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ARGRE通过精确建模毒性转换空间，实现了高效且有效的LLM去毒，为安全部署提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

### [21] [Feasibility of Structuring Stress Documentation Using an Ontology-Guided Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01244)
*Hyeoneui Kim,Jeongha Kim,Huijing Xu,Jinsun Jung,Sunghoon Kang,Sun Joo Jang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了心理压力本体论(MeSO)，并评估了使用大语言模型从文本中提取结构化压力信息的可行性，准确率达到78.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压力对健康有重要影响，但在电子健康记录中通常以非结构化文本形式记录，限制了临床效用。环境AI技术虽然能减轻文档负担，但主要生成非结构化叙述。

Method: 开发心理压力本体论(MeSO)，整合理论模型和11个验证过的压力评估工具，使用大语言模型从35个Reddit帖子中提取六类压力相关信息，并由人工评估准确性。

Result: 最终本体包含8个顶级类别的181个概念。在220个可提取的压力相关项目中，LLM正确识别172个(78.2%)，错误分类27个(12.3%)，遗漏21个(9.5%)。所有正确提取的项目都能准确映射到MeSO。

Conclusion: 研究表明使用本体引导的LLM进行结构化压力信息提取是可行的，有望提高环境AI系统中压力文档的一致性和实用性。

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeMob是一个基于LLM的语义合成管道，用于动态移动性预测，通过多智能体框架从在线文本中提取时空相关信息，并结合时空数据实现更准确的事件驱动预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空模型难以利用描述外部事件的文本信息来预测人类移动性的突然变化，需要一种能够整合文本语义和时空数据的方法。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，LLM智能体自动从复杂在线文本中提取和推理时空相关文本，通过渐进融合架构将细粒度上下文与时空数据结合，利用预训练事件先验。

Result: 在构建的数据集上评估，SeMob相比纯时空模型在MAE和RMSE上分别最大降低了13.92%和11.12%，在事件发生时空区域附近表现尤为优越。

Conclusion: SeMob框架通过整合文本语义和时空数据，显著提升了事件驱动的人类移动性预测准确性，特别是在事件相关时空区域。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

### [23] [A Comparative Analysis of Sparse Autoencoder and Activation Difference in Language Model Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01246)
*Jiaqing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）的top-1潜在特征进行语言模型引导，并引入token-wise衰减引导策略，有效提升数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有top-k SAE潜在特征方法会捕捉非语义特征（如标点符号），而常数SAE引导会产生退化输出（如重复单词），需要改进引导策略。

Method: 采用top-1 SAE潜在特征聚焦最相关维度，并提出token-wise衰减引导策略，避免输出退化。

Result: 实验表明，引导与推理相关的SAE潜在特征能可靠地引发逐步数学推理，在数学推理基准上优于均值激活差异方法，在IF-Eval上表现相当。

Conclusion: SAE是一种有效的语言模型引导工具，通过top-1特征选择和衰减引导策略，能显著提升推理质量，功能上类似于添加引导token的效果。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

Result: 创建了涵盖60个国家、6大洲传统体育的综合性基准，为评估AI对传统体育文化的理解能力提供了新标准。

Conclusion: CultSportQA为评估AI在传统体育文化领域的理解和推理能力建立了新的基准，填补了现有评估体系的空白。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are primarily evaluated on globally popular sports,
often overlooking regional and indigenous sporting traditions. To address this
gap, we introduce \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}}, a benchmark designed to assess
LMs' understanding of traditional sports across 60 countries and 6 continents,
encompassing four distinct cultural categories. The dataset features 33,000
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across text and image modalities, each of
which is categorized into three key types: history-based, rule-based, and
scenario-based. To evaluate model performance, we employ zero-shot, few-shot,
and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language
Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLMs). By providing a comprehensive multilingual and multicultural
sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for
assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图学习方法通常在单个图数据集上训练，缺乏跨图和跨任务的泛化能力，且严重依赖大量标注数据。与NLP和CV不同，图数据具有异构性和结构多样性，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出SSTAG方法，利用文本作为统一表示媒介，通过双重知识蒸馏框架将LLM和GNN共同蒸馏到结构感知MLP中，并引入内存机制存储典型图表示以整合不变知识。

Result: 大量实验表明，SSTAG在跨域迁移学习任务上优于最先进模型，具有出色的可扩展性，在保持竞争力的同时降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: SSTAG成功弥合了LLM的语义推理能力和GNN的结构建模能力之间的差距，为大规模文本属性图提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学问题解决中可靠性不足，现有科学问答数据集错误率高，主要由于答案中的逻辑跳跃和隐含推理。

Method: LOCA框架通过增强和审查循环自动清理科学语料库，核心是补全缺失的逻辑步骤，明确分离科学原理与其后续推导。

Result: 应用LOCA到具有挑战性的科学语料库，能够自动过滤噪声数据集，通常将错误率从高达20%降至2%以下。

Conclusion: LOCA为创建高质量科学语料库提供了可扩展且有效的方法论，为更可靠的科学AI训练和评估铺平了道路。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

Abstract: As social-media platforms emerge and evolve faster than the regulations meant
to oversee them, automated detoxification might serve as a timely tool for
moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual
transformer, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA SFT fine-tuning and prompting
techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of
performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在实体链接任务中需要多轮推理来估计不确定性，计算资源需求高，限制了实际应用。需要更高效的不确定性估计方法。

Method: 使用自监督方法从单次LLM输出中提取token级特征来估计不确定性，无需多次生成。

Result: 在多个LLM的表格数据实体链接任务评估中，该方法能有效检测低准确率输出，计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM实体链接工作流提供了计算成本可控的不确定性估计方案，支持实际应用部署。

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在大量未筛选语料上训练，理解模型表示及其内部化的数据已成为主要挑战。需要开发可扩展的方法来探索复杂数据集和发现模型中的偏见。

Method: 在简·奥斯汀小说语料上训练GPT风格的transformer模型，然后跨多个层应用稀疏自编码器到隐藏状态，以发现稀疏可解释的特征。

Conclusion: LLMs与SAEs结合可作为探索复杂数据集的可扩展探针，为语料探索、偏见发现和模型可解释性提供了新路径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

*Shree Harsha Bokkahalli Satish,Gustav Eje Henter,Éva Székely*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文质疑当前语音大语言模型偏见评估中使用的多项选择题格式的有效性，发现这种评估方法无法可靠预测模型在其他任务格式中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型的偏见评估主要依赖多项选择题格式，但这种方法假设模型在其他任务格式中表现一致。论文旨在验证这一假设是否成立。

Method: 使用LoRA适配器微调三个SpeechLLMs，诱导它们偏好刻板印象、反刻板印象或中性答案，然后评估这些行为是否能在其他MCQA基准测试和长格式生成任务中泛化。

Result: 结果显示，MCQA偏见基准测试的表现无法可靠预测其他MCQA基准测试的表现，更重要的是无法预测长格式任务的表现。

Conclusion: 当前MCQA偏见基准测试在语音领域显示有限的跨任务泛化能力，论文提出了评估行为可迁移性的测试套件。

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

*Yunlang Dai,Emma Lurie,Danaé Metaxa,Sorelle A. Friedler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了AI Watchman系统来纵向审计LLM的拒绝行为，通过400多个社会议题测试发现能检测未公开的政策变化，并识别不同公司和模型的审核差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的输出受到不透明且频繁变更的公司内容审核政策影响，这些拒绝行为既反映公司政策又微妙地塑造公共话语，需要透明度工具来监控。

Method: 使用包含400多个社会议题的数据集，纵向审计OpenAI的审核端点、GPT-4.1、GPT-5和DeepSeek（中英文版本），并定性分析拒绝形式。

Result: AI Watchman能检测到未公开宣布的公司政策变化，识别出公司和模型特定的内容审核差异，并对不同拒绝形式进行了分类分析。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了纵向审计LLM的价值，AI Watchman是实现这一目标的可行系统，为理解LLM内容审核提供了透明度工具。

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RJE框架，通过检索-判断-探索机制改进知识图谱问答，使用专业辅助模块让小型LLM也能有效工作，显著减少LLM调用次数和token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的KGQA方法存在局限性：检索方法受限于检索质量，智能体方法依赖专有LLM。需要解决这些问题并让小型开源LLM也能有效工作。

Method: RJE框架包含三个核心组件：检索精炼推理路径、评估充分性、条件性探索额外证据。引入三个专业辅助模块：推理路径排序、问题分解、检索器辅助探索。

Result: 使用专有LLM时优于现有基线，小型开源LLM（3B和8B参数）无需微调即可达到竞争性结果，显著减少LLM调用次数和token使用。

Conclusion: RJE框架有效解决了现有KGQA方法的局限性，实现了高性能和高效率，使小型LLM也能在KGQA任务中发挥重要作用。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

*Nathan Junzi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用零样本分类方法评估6个主流大语言模型的政治偏见，发现所有模型都表现出增强的自由-威权主义倾向，存在推理替代和格式化拒绝现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI快速普及，但训练数据偏差、人类偏见和算法缺陷导致的政治偏见持续影响这一新技术，需要系统评估算法政治党派性。

Method: 采用零样本分类方法，结合意识形态对齐、主题性、响应情感和客观性四个维度，对6个主流LLMs的1800个模型响应进行精细分类算法评估。

Result: 所有6个评估的LLMs都显示出增强的自由-威权主义对齐倾向，存在显著的推理替代和格式化拒绝实例。

Conclusion: 研究强调人机交互中的心理影响，内在偏见可能渗透公共话语，扭曲政治格局，最终表现为从众或极化，取决于地区既有的社会政治结构。

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

*Nils Durner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过测试OpenAI的200亿参数开源模型gpt-oss-20b，探究了社会语用框架、语言选择和指令层次对模型拒绝行为的影响，发现特定提示策略可以显著改变模型的协助率，并揭示了跨语言和推理堆栈的拒绝率差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解大型语言模型在面对有害请求时的拒绝行为如何受到提示框架、语言选择和指令设计的影响，以评估模型安全性的鲁棒性和可复现性。

Method: 研究方法包括：在80次种子迭代中测试多个危害领域；使用复合提示策略（教育者角色、安全前提、步骤提示）；比较不同语言（英语、德语、法语）的拒绝行为；引入AI辅助强化方法；采用配对追踪设计测试评估意识。

Result: 研究发现：复合提示可以将ZIP炸弹任务的协助率从0%提升到97.5%；德语和法语的正式语体比英语更容易泄露信息；"Linux终端"角色扮演可以覆盖开发者规则；AI辅助强化方法在某些情况下可以将泄露率降至0%；不同推理堆栈的拒绝率存在5-10个百分点的差异。

Conclusion: 结论是语言模型的拒绝行为高度依赖于提示框架和语言选择，当前的安全评估方法存在局限性，需要更鲁棒的评估框架来确保模型安全性的可复现性。

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

*Isa Inuwa-Dutse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现OpenAI GPT-OSS-20b模型在低资源语言（豪萨语）环境下存在严重的安全漏洞，包括生成有害内容、文化不敏感和事实错误，模型的安全协议在礼貌语言下会放松，导致错误信息传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑模型对代表性不足社区用户的可靠性，特别是在低资源语言环境下的安全对齐表现。

Method: 使用豪萨语进行红队测试，通过最小提示诱导模型生成有害内容，并进行了61人参与的调查验证模型错误。

Result: 模型在豪萨语中表现出偏见、不准确性和文化不敏感性，错误地认为常见杀虫剂和灭鼠剂对人类安全，无法区分生食和加工食品，使用贬低性文化谚语构建错误论点。

Conclusion: 这些问题源于语言奖励黑客行为，模型优先考虑目标语言的流利输出而非安全性和真实性，主要归因于低资源语言环境下安全调优不足。

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

Motivation: 现有基于logits的AI文本检测器仅依赖对数概率统计，这可能不是最优的检测方法，需要更有效的检测技术来区分人类和LLM生成的文本。

Method: 提出AdaDetectGPT分类器，通过从训练数据中自适应学习见证函数来增强基于logits的检测器性能，并提供统计保证。

Result: 广泛的数值研究表明，AdaDetectGPT在各种数据集和LLM组合中几乎一致地改进了现有最先进方法，改进幅度最高可达58%。

Conclusion: AdaDetectGPT通过自适应学习见证函数有效提升了AI文本检测性能，为区分人类和LLM生成文本提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成连贯和上下文相关文本方面表现出色，但其部署存在生成有害或不适当内容的风险，需要有效的安全防护机制。

Method: 渐进式自我反思（PSR）是一种推理时技术，通过多轮自我反思动态修正模型输出，并引入轻量级自我反思预测器来根据输入复杂度自适应确定最优反思轮数。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct上攻击成功率从77.5%降至5.9%，在Llama-3.1-8B基础模型上从89.7%降至5.6%，在Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct上从44.4%降至3.8%，且不影响良性任务性能。

Conclusion: 渐进式自我反思作为一种可扩展的测试时方法，通过根据输入风险特征动态分配计算资源，有效提升了大语言模型的安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

Motivation: 扩散大语言模型中的幻觉问题研究不足，现有基于单步生成的检测方法不适用于多步去噪过程，限制了D-LLMs在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为动作轨迹，每个动作定义为模型基于前一个中间输出对清理后响应的预测，识别对幻觉响应最具有信息量的子轨迹。

Result: 在各种开源D-LLMs上的广泛实验表明，TraceDet持续改进幻觉检测性能，相比基线方法在AUROC指标上平均提升15.2%。

Conclusion: TraceDet通过利用D-LLMs多步去噪过程中的关键幻觉信号，有效解决了现有方法不适用于扩散大语言模型的问题，显著提升了幻觉检测性能。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes

Motivation: 现有工具增强的LLM虽然整合了代码解释器和搜索等功能，但缺乏如何有效组合文本推理、编码和搜索的实用指导

Method: TUMIX是一个集成框架，并行运行多个代理，每个代理采用不同的工具使用策略和答案路径，通过迭代共享和精炼回答

Result: 在Gemini-2.5-Pro和Gemini-2.5-Flash上，TUMIX相比最先进的工具增强方法平均准确率提升达3.55%，推理成本相近

Conclusion: 代理多样性和质量至关重要，可通过LLM自动优化代理设计来增强；TUMIX可在达到足够置信度时停止精炼，以49%的推理成本保持性能

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

TL;DR: HiSpec提出了一种分层推测解码框架，利用早期退出模型进行低开销的中间验证，显著提升了LLM推理吞吐量，平均提升1.28倍，最高可达2.01倍，且不损失准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码中验证阶段是瓶颈（如3B模型为70B目标模型推测时，验证比token生成慢4倍），现有中间验证方法存在训练开销大、内存占用增加和准确性受损的问题。

Method: 利用早期退出模型进行中间验证，这些模型允许token提前退出层遍历，并经过训练使选定层的隐藏状态可解释；设计方法重用key-value缓存和隐藏状态；定期验证中间验证器接受的draft token。

Result: 在各种代表性基准测试和模型上，HiSpec相比基线单层推测平均提升吞吐量1.28倍，最高可达2.01倍，且不损害准确性。

Conclusion: HiSpec通过早期退出模型实现高效中间验证，显著提升推测解码吞吐量，同时保持准确性，解决了验证瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline

*Maithili Kadam,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAG-EQA是一个提示框架，通过将因果事件图转换为自然语言语句注入LLM输入，提升事件问答性能，在TORQUESTRA基准测试上平均准确率提高5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在一般语言任务上表现出色，但在需要因果或时间推理的事件性问题方面存在困难。

Method: 引入TAG-EQA框架，将结构化因果事件图转换为自然语言语句注入LLM输入，包含9种提示配置，结合三种策略（零样本、少样本、思维链）和三种输入模式（纯文本、纯图、文本+图）。

Result: 在TORQUESTRA基准测试上，TAG-EQA比纯文本基线平均准确率提高5%，零样本设置下提升达12%，图增强思维链提示有效时提升达18%。

Conclusion: 因果图可以在不进行微调的情况下增强LLM的事件推理能力，为基于提示的问答提供了一种灵活的结构编码方式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

*Nicolás Aguirre,Ramiro Caso,Ramiro Rodríguez Colmeiro,Mauro Santelli,Joaquín Toranzo Calderón*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义嵌入距离的无结构评估方法，用于低成本自动评估语言模型响应质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型响应评估方法要么过于昂贵（如LLM-as-a-Judge），要么远离真实条件（如字符串匹配、logprob），需要更实用且低成本的解决方案

Method: 使用语义嵌入距离来匹配目标候选与任意LM生成的文本，通过小于100亿参数的嵌入模型实现低成本响应分类

Result: 在3个数据集和3种不同LM架构上测试，回归分数约0.97，相对于人工标注的准确率约96%

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算成本相对较低但鲁棒的语言模型响应分类方案

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Expert Question Decomposition (EQD)方法，通过两阶段微调框架和奖励函数优化子问题生成，在金融领域复杂问答任务中显著提升性能，仅需少量训练数据和单GPU即可实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在领域特定定量推理中的挑战，特别是在需要专业知识和复杂问答的领域，如金融领域。

Method: 基于两阶段微调框架的专家问题分解方法，使用奖励函数评估生成子问题对问答结果改进的有效性，仅需数千训练示例和单A100 GPU进行微调。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上评估，EQD在不同大语言模型上持续提升问答性能0.6%到10.5%，优于最先进的领域调优模型和高级提示策略。

Conclusion: 在领域特定问答中，单个支持性问题比详细指导步骤提供更大收益，EQD方法在平衡领域知识与计算效率方面表现优异。

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSSFormer是一个递归稀疏结构化Transformer，通过递归推理、自适应稀疏注意力和自组织编码器结构，解决了传统Transformer在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer架构在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面存在挑战，主要由于刚性层堆叠、密集注意力机制和对位置编码的依赖。

Method: 集成三个创新：递归推理与记忆单元(R2MU)用于有界深度迭代推理，自适应稀疏注意力模块(ASAM)用于高效聚焦上下文选择，自组织编码器结构(SOES)用于无位置结构归纳。

Result: 在语言建模、多跳问答和结构敏感任务中，ReSSFormer在可比较的FLOPs和参数预算下始终优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: ReSSFormer展示了其可扩展性、效率和结构灵活性，为Transformer架构提供了改进方案。

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,
efficiency, and structural flexibility.

*Zhenwen Liang,Ruosen Li,Yujun Zhou,Linfeng Song,Dian Yu,Xinya Du,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLUE是一个基于隐藏状态的无参数验证器，通过分析LLM内部隐藏状态的几何特征来验证输出正确性，无需训练参数即可提升推理任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖文本层面信息或token概率，容易过拟合或受模型校准度影响。隐藏状态作为更丰富的信息源，能统一支持验证任务。

Method: CLUE通过计算隐藏状态轨迹的delta变化，使用最近邻聚类方法将推理轨迹分类到"成功"和"失败"簇，无需可训练参数。

Result: 在AIME 24/25和GPQA数据集上，CLUE持续优于LLM作为评判基准，匹配或超过现代置信度方法，显著提升top-1和多数投票准确率。

Conclusion: 隐藏状态包含可分离的几何特征，能够有效验证LLM输出正确性，CLUE的简洁设计证明了该信号的强大潜力。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

Result: 所有微调策略在EM和F1生成质量指标上取得了大致相同的改进，但计算成本存在显著差异。

Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs),
Fine-tuning, Question Answering, Joint fine-tuning TL;DR: We evaluate and
compare strategies for fine-tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines, including independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase
fine-tuning. Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular
framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

MonoT5) to optimize context selection before synthesizing evidence through a
fine-tuned T5 model. Experimental results on the PubMedQA dataset show
significant improvements over baselines, with our best model achieving
substantial gains across BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics, advancing the state
of accessible, evidence-based biomedical knowledge retrieval.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PureTC-1B，一个针对Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct的三阶段稳定化流程，通过参数高效的LoRA适配器解决传统中文模型中的token级不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在传统中文部署中存在token级不稳定性问题，模型会不可预测地输出非传统中文字符或切换到其他语言，这阻碍了成本效益高、设备端和延迟敏感的AI应用。

Method: 使用三阶段稳定化流程：1）在TC中心语料库上进行持续预训练；2）使用指令数据进行监督微调；3）使用TC一致性偏好进行直接偏好优化，通过参数高效的LoRA适配器实现，无需完整模型重新训练。

Result: 在模拟真实世界使用的基准测试中，PureTC-1B相比基础模型减少了51.3%的非TC输出token；在命名实体翻译任务中，相比Llama-3B和Qwen-1.5B分别减少了77.2%和57.2%的错误语言token。

Conclusion: 即使在1B规模下，也能实现稳健的传统中文一致性，该流程可重现、仅使用适配器且硬件友好，为TC和其他非英语语言提供了实用的语言稳定性增强方案。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

TL;DR: AMAS是一个革命性的多智能体系统框架，通过动态图设计器自动识别任务特定的最优图配置，解决了传统MAS架构因固定拓扑结构导致的性能限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体系统架构受限于僵化的手工构建图拓扑，缺乏上下文响应性，导致在不同学术和商业工作负载中效果下降。

Method: 引入动态图设计器，通过轻量级LLM适配自主识别任务特定的最优图配置，利用输入的内在特性智能引导查询轨迹通过任务优化的智能体路径。

Result: 在问答、数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，AMAS系统性地超越了最先进的单智能体和多智能体方法，适用于多种LLM架构。

Conclusion: 上下文敏感的结构适应性是高性能LLM多智能体系统部署的基本要求。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在漏洞，恶意用户可以通过操纵输入文本来获取不良响应。这些越狱提示旨在绕过安全防护措施，因此需要有效的方法来识别它们。

Method: 使用不同机器学习模型区分越狱提示和真实使用，包括检测使用新策略的越狱提示。最佳方法是端到端微调BERT模型进行越狱识别。

Result: 在当前数据集上，微调BERT模型在识别越狱提示方面表现最佳。通过可视化分析发现，提示结构中的显式自反性可以区分越狱意图。

Conclusion: 端到端微调BERT模型是检测越狱提示的有效方法，提示结构中的显式自反性可作为越狱意图的识别信号。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

Conclusion: 未在摘要中明确说明

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
performance in language understanding and generation. However, their
application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the
analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the
constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络安全领域缺乏定义安全系统自主能力的框架、评估闭环代理的原则方法以及衡量其性能的基准，导致防御系统难以跟上AI驱动的攻击系统发展。

Method: 引入CLASP框架，将安全生命周期（侦察、利用、根因分析、补丁合成、验证）与核心自主能力（规划、工具使用、记忆、推理、反思与感知）对齐，并定义CLC评分来量化闭环程度和操作有效性。

Result: 应用CLASP分析了21个代表性工作，识别了系统优势和能力差距，并提出了闭环基准的要求。

Conclusion: CLASP和CLC评分提供了推进功能级性能和测量闭环安全代理所需的词汇、诊断和测量工具。

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.

Motivation: 多模态对话摘要需要强大的自动评估方法来降低成本，但这需要一个基于人工标注的元评估基准。

Method: 提出了MEKI（模态间互斥关键信息）过滤框架来确保数据质量，并首次形式化了MDS特有的关键评估维度。

Result: 基准测试显示现有评估方法在区分先进MLLM生成的摘要方面存在局限，且容易受到各种偏见影响。

Conclusion: MDSEval为MDS评估提供了首个全面的元评估基准，揭示了现有方法的不足，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust
automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human
effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark
grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced
MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

TL;DR: FOR-Prompting是一种非对称推理协议，通过Defender提出答案、Objectioner提出质疑、Host确保一致性的角色结构，实现自我修正，在GSM8K任务上相比单提示提升约22个百分点，与CoT准确率相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理协议如Chain of Thought和Tree of Thought缺乏明确的外部质疑机制来引发自我修正，需要一种能够通过质疑引导模型进行自我修订的方法。

Method: 采用非对称协议，包含三个角色：Defender提出初始答案，Objectioner提出质疑但不直接提供修正，Host确保对话一致性和结束。协议在提示层面通过角色结构化轮次实现，无需重新训练。

Result: 在GSM8K任务上相比单提示提升约22个百分点，与CoT准确率相当；GPT 4.1评估显示推理和连贯性评分提高10%以上；小模型性能显著提升（Llama3.2:1b在GSM8K任务上准确率提升约19%）。

Conclusion: FOR-Prompting能够在不使用工具或人工监督的情况下修正错误，适用于不同规模的模型，支持大规模质疑引导推理研究，在开放任务中展现出增强的探索和精炼能力。

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否真正使用组合机制来解决组合任务，特别是两跳事实回忆任务。

Method: 使用logit lens分析残差流激活，识别模型在计算g(f(x))时的处理机制，并研究嵌入空间几何对机制选择的影响。

Result: 确认LLMs存在组合性差距，识别出两种处理机制：组合式（计算f(x)作为中间步骤）和直接式（无中间变量f(x)的痕迹），机制选择与嵌入空间线性映射存在相关。

Conclusion: LLMs解决组合任务的方式取决于嵌入空间几何特性，存在组合性差距，模型可能绕过组合推理而采用直接映射的方式。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

Motivation: 医疗预咨询任务中，SFT训练数据的轮次分布偏斜导致LLMs在长对话中出现格式惯性问题，生成重复但诊断价值低的问题。

Method: 采用数据为中心的方法，重新平衡训练数据集的轮次分布。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著缓解了医疗预咨询中的格式惯性问题。

Conclusion: 通过简单调整训练数据的轮次分布，可以有效解决LLMs在医疗预咨询任务中的格式惯性问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant
improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical
pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common
approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

TL;DR: MathLens是一个新的多模态推理基准测试，专门用于分解几何问题中的感知、推理和整合能力，揭示不同训练方法对各子技能的差异化影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型的评估主要依赖总体准确率，这种单一评分掩盖了模型在感知、推理和整合等具体能力上的改进细节，需要更细粒度的评估方法。

Method: 通过从问题的符号规范中派生出视觉图表、文本描述、控制问题和感知探针等标注，构建MathLens基准测试，将性能分解为感知、推理和整合三个组件。

Result: 分析发现：强化学习主要增强感知能力；推理能力只有在感知能力提升时才能改进；整合能力是最薄弱的环节；不同训练方法在鲁棒性上表现各异。

Conclusion: 多模态推理需要针对不同子技能进行专门评估，不同训练方法对各能力有差异化影响，整合能力是需要重点改进的方向。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

TL;DR: 将工程设计标准中的信息转化为模块化、可重用、机器可解释的本体，并在工厂设计和设备选择过程中用于质量保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管工业工作数字化是目标，但产品规格、产品类型数据表和设计标准仍然主要是文档中心化的。需要将这些信息转化为机器可解释的形式以实现自动化验证。

Method: 使用建模模式为国际管道、材料和阀门设计标准中的文本和表格创建模块化本体，这些模块基于ISO DIS 23726-3工业数据本体(IDO)，并以W3C兼容格式存储。

Result: 在阀门选择过程中测试了这些本体，能够自动验证特定阀门数据表是否符合相关行业标准，并通过语义推理和可执行设计规则确定产品类型是否满足阀门规格。

Conclusion: 创建基于IDO的共享、可重用模块化本体使语义推理能够应用于设备选择过程，展示了这种方法对于希望过渡到数字化智能标准的标准机构的潜力。

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply
with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design
standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize
industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information
held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

TL;DR: 提出了Refusal Index (RI)指标，通过拒绝概率与错误概率的秩相关性来准确衡量LLMs对未知问题的拒绝能力，解决了现有指标存在的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标无法准确衡量LLMs的知识感知拒绝能力：简单拒绝率指标受拒绝倾向影响，校准指标是代理指标。需要开发能真实反映模型拒绝行为的指标。

Method: 定义RI为拒绝概率与错误概率的Spearman秩相关性，设计轻量级两轮评估方法，通过两次标准评估运行中的观察拒绝率来有效估计RI。

Result: 在16个模型和5个数据集上的实验表明，RI能准确量化模型在事实任务中的内在知识感知拒绝能力，且在不同拒绝率下保持稳定，提供一致的模型排名。

Conclusion: RI揭示了LLMs事实性的重要但被忽视的方面：虽然LLMs在事实任务中准确率高，但其拒绝行为可能不可靠且脆弱。需要将RI与传统准确率指标结合进行全面事实性评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了16种无监督指标在从俄罗斯司法判决中提取语义块的质量，发现词频一致性和覆盖率比等指标与专家评分最一致，而LLM评估得分仅显示中等一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律自然语言处理的快速发展需要可扩展的方法来评估从司法判决中提取文本的质量，特别是在缺乏预标注真实数据的情况下。

Method: 使用16种无监督指标评估从1000份匿名俄罗斯司法判决中提取7个语义块的质量，包括文档基础、语义、结构、伪真实数据和法律特定类别指标，并通过7168个专家评分进行验证。

Result: 词频一致性（Pearson r=0.540）和覆盖率比/块完整性（Pearson r=0.513）与专家评分最一致，而法律术语密度显示强负相关（Pearson r=-0.479）。LLM评估得分仅显示中等一致性（Pearson r=0.382）。

Conclusion: 无监督指标包括基于LLM的方法可实现可扩展筛选，但由于中等相关性和低一致性系数，无法在高风险法律环境中完全替代人类判断。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)能够生成高度逼真的垃圾评论，这些评论模仿人类写作，对现有检测系统构成挑战，威胁在线平台的可信度。

Method: 提出FraudSquad混合检测模型，结合预训练语言模型的文本嵌入和门控图变换器进行垃圾节点分类，无需手动特征工程或大量训练资源。

Result: 在三个LLM生成的垃圾评论数据集上，FraudSquad比最先进基线方法在精确率和召回率上分别提升高达44.22%和43.01%，在两个人类撰写的垃圾数据集上也表现良好。

Conclusion: FraudSquad模型大小适中，需要少量标注训练数据，是应对LLM时代垃圾检测挑战的实用解决方案，强调需要适应LLM时代的垃圾检测需求。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly
persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose
significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the
credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic
LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by
product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm
the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this
threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text
embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for
spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are

TL;DR: LLMs在数学问题解决中存在语法盲点，即使语义简单但表述陌生的题目也会错误应用推理策略。通过降低句法复杂度的重述可以显著提高正确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs在数学问题解决中的系统性失败模式——语法盲点，即模型会将熟悉的推理策略错误应用于语义简单但表述陌生的题目，这反映了表面形式与内部表示的脆弱耦合。

Method: 使用从正确示例中提取的句法模板重述错误回答的问题，保持语义不变但降低结构复杂度；使用基于依存局部理论的指标量化句法复杂度。

Result: 重述后的问题往往能得到正确答案；更高的DLT分数与多个数据集中的失败率增加相关。

Conclusion: 许多推理错误源于结构错位而非概念难度，语法感知干预可以揭示和缓解这些归纳失败。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网页中的半结构化内容（如HTML表格、列表和信息框）包含大量事实数据，但现有方法要么缺乏泛化能力，要么因每页都需要LLM推理而资源密集。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，利用同一网站内网页的布局相似性作为奖励信号，生成可重用的提取脚本，并在CommonCrawl数据上进行迭代训练。

Result: 在脚本质量上比强基线高出13%以上，将GPT-4o的下游问答准确率提高了4%以上。

Conclusion: SCRIBES实现了可扩展且资源高效的网页信息提取，解决了半结构化内容提取的挑战。

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

Conclusion: 多模态模型确实在纯语言任务上表现不足，模型融合方法能部分改善这一问题，同时维持多模态能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

Result: 在多个模型系列中，编辑准确率提升10%-30%，显著减少知识遗忘。

Conclusion: 为开发可靠、可扩展且持续演进的LLM提供了一个稳健框架。

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and
continually evolving LLMs.

introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide
actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM

Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and
underdeveloped, unlike prior work on classifiers. To further promote
adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a
unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to
input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by
inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers.
ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems,
potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation
LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more
controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 在线强化学习对于精确和忠实的声明验证非常有效，为未来研究提供了基础，并发布了代码以支持社区在LLM赋能声明验证方面的进展。

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and
faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We
release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim
verification.

TL;DR: 该研究探索语言模型能否通过个体的多维度主观标注（情感、情绪、论证、主题）来预测其价值观念，发现同时提供所有维度信息能显著提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于价值观念受社会文化背景和生活经历影响而具有主观性，为了让AI系统能与多样化的人类观点对齐并避免偏向多数观点，需要识别个体的价值解释。

Method: 使用SEAT（情感、情绪、论证、主题）多维度主观标注作为个体解释视角的代理，在不同零样本和少样本设置下评估语言模型预测个体价值解释的能力。

Result: 实验表明同时提供所有SEAT维度比单独维度或无个体信息的基线表现更优，且不同标注者之间存在显著个体差异。

Conclusion: 这是首个超越人口统计学特征，研究标注行为对价值预测影响的尝试，为未来大规模验证提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation
behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future
large-scale validation.

### [72] [Exploring Database Normalization Effects on SQL Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01989)
*Ryosuke Kohita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统分析了数据库模式规范化对NL2SQL系统性能的影响，发现去规范化模式在简单检索查询中表现更好，而规范化模式在聚合查询中更优，最佳模式设计取决于查询类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模式设计特别是规范化是NL2SQL系统中关键但常被忽视的因素，现有研究多在固定模式上评估模型，忽略了设计对性能的影响。

Method: 评估八个领先的大语言模型，使用具有不同规范化级别的合成和真实数据集，构建了形式化规范化(1NF-3NF)的合成数据集和实际学术论文数据集。

Result: 去规范化模式在简单检索查询中准确率高，即使使用零样本设置的成本效益模型；规范化模式(2NF/3NF)在基础表选择和连接类型预测方面存在挑战，但通过少量样本示例可显著缓解；对于聚合查询，规范化模式因避免数据重复和NULL值问题而表现更好。

Conclusion: NL2SQL应用的最佳模式设计取决于支持的查询类型，开发NL2SQL接口时应考虑模式设计，并为实际场景集成自适应模式选择。

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了第一个多任务孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集BanglaMultiHate，并通过实验比较了传统基线、单语预训练模型和LLM在零样本提示和LoRA微调下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线社交媒体平台虽然具有积极作用，但也成为仇恨言论、攻击性语言和欺凌内容的温床，特别是在低资源语言如孟加拉语中，现有的检测系统多为单任务且覆盖范围有限。

Method: 构建了多任务孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集BanglaMultiHate，并进行了全面的实验比较，包括传统基线方法、单语预训练模型和LLM的零样本提示及LoRA微调。

Result: 实验表明，虽然LoRA微调的LLM与BanglaBERT表现相当，但文化和语言基础的预训练对于稳健性能仍然至关重要。

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源环境下开发文化对齐的内容审核工具建立了更强的基准，并将发布数据集和相关脚本以确保可复现性。

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and
information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also
provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a
low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs
are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and
findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned
moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release
the dataset and all related scripts.

TL;DR: 本研究采用过程导向方法，通过约束性决策分析LLM作为计算作者的创造力，发现模型普遍更重视风格而非其他叙事元素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对大型语言模型创造力的评估主要关注输出质量而非创作过程，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用受控提示分配作者角色，基于约束决策分析模型的创意偏好，并探究其选择理由。

Result: LLM一致性地强调风格元素，超越角色、事件和场景等其他叙事要素，不同模型展现出独特的创意特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析AI作者创造力提供了新颖的系统性工具，揭示了模型在叙事创作中的偏好模式。

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused
primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape
them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to
examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based
decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting
to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the
models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other
elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the
reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive
profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel
systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

TL;DR: 提出了Streaming RAG框架，通过在用户说话时并行预测工具查询来降低端到端语音对话系统的幻觉问题，显著提高了问答准确性和响应速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音对话系统虽然能生成更自然、低延迟的响应，但容易产生幻觉，缺乏事实基础。文本对话系统通过集成工具来解决这个问题，但语音系统尚未实现类似功能。

Method: 开发了Streaming RAG框架，包括后训练流程，教导模型在用户说话过程中预测何时调用工具，并生成融合音频查询和检索文本结果的语音摘要。

Result: 在AudioCRAG基准测试中，QA准确率相对提升200%（从11.1%到34.2%），工具使用延迟降低20%。

Conclusion: Streaming RAG方法有效解决了语音对话系统的幻觉问题，提高了准确性和响应性，且该方法与模态无关，可应用于文本输入，为实时AI助手的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for
more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SCoT：一种用于双工口语对话系统的流式思维链框架，通过交替处理固定时长的用户输入和分块生成响应，解决了传统VAD无法区分停顿和对话完成的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端口语对话系统依赖语音活动检测进行话轮转换，但VAD无法区分停顿和对话完成。现有的双工SDS模型虽然通过预测包括静音标记的连续输出来避免显式VAD，但架构复杂且在语义推理上落后于级联模型。

Method: 提出流式思维链框架SCoT，交替处理固定时长的用户输入和分块生成响应。利用帧级对齐为每个块创建中间目标——对齐的用户转录和系统响应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比现有双工方法产生更连贯和可解释的响应，同时相比逐轮系统支持更低延迟和重叠交互。

Conclusion: SCoT框架在保持双工系统优势的同时，显著提升了响应质量和交互效率。

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable
responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and
overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推测解码技术在不同任务间速度提升的不均衡现象，特别是对欠拟合和代表性不足任务加速效果较差的问题。

Method: 通过理论分析量化推测解码的不公平性，并提出一种缓解策略来减少速度提升差异。

Result: 提出的缓解策略在多个模型对上验证，公平性指标平均提升了12%。

Conclusion: 推测解码技术存在任务间速度提升不公平的问题，需要专门设计策略来缓解这种差异，确保技术对所有任务都能公平受益。

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

TL;DR: RESTRAIN是一个自惩罚强化学习框架，通过利用模型整个答案分布中的信号，在无标签数据上实现推理能力的持续自我提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人工标注数据的强化学习方法成本高昂且在困难任务上表现不佳，需要一种无需标注数据就能自我提升的经验驱动学习方法。

Method: 提出RESTRAIN框架，通过自惩罚机制惩罚过度自信的推理路径和低一致性样本，同时保留有希望的推理链，可无缝集成到GRPO等策略优化方法中。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B-Base和OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base模型上，RESTRAIN在AIME25上提升Pass@1达+140.7%，在MMLU_STEM上提升+36.2%，在GPQA-Diamond上提升+19.6%，几乎达到有标签训练的效果。

Conclusion: RESTRAIN为无需黄金标签构建更强推理能力提供了一条可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

TL;DR: 提出RL4HS强化学习框架，通过跨度级奖励函数激励推理，用于检测大语言模型生成的幻觉跨度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作将幻觉检测视为二元任务，但实际应用需要识别幻觉跨度，这是一个多步决策过程。显式推理可能有助于检测幻觉跨度。

Method: 首先评估带和不带思维链推理的预训练模型，然后提出RL4HS强化学习框架，基于组相对策略优化并引入类感知策略优化来解决奖励不平衡问题。

Result: 在RAGTruth基准测试（摘要、问答、数据到文本）上，RL4HS超越了预训练推理模型和监督微调。

Conclusion: 强化学习与跨度级奖励对于检测幻觉跨度是必要的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPARQL查询语言对非计算机背景用户门槛较高，需要降低知识图谱交互难度；Text2SPARQL挑战赛推动该领域改进

Method: 基于SPINACH的LLM代理，采用迭代式探索执行过程而非单次翻译，包含整体架构设计和决策理由

Result: 进行了代理行为深入分析，为未来针对性改进提供洞察

Conclusion: 该方法能有效降低知识图谱查询门槛，分析结果为后续改进指明了方向

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a
background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)
has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that
barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this
paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent
that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single
shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the
overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also
conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future
areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL
challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the
Text2SPARQL domain.

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法主要依赖自我探索或单一教师指导，容易引入模型偏见并限制探索，影响推理多样性和性能。

Method: 提出自适应多指导策略优化(AMPO)，仅在策略模型失败时从多个熟练教师模型获取指导，并采用基于理解的路径选择机制。

Conclusion: AMPO展示了实现卓越推理和泛化能力的更高效、可扩展路径，使用四个同等规模教师即可达到更强大单教师方法的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including
the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X
(formerly known as Twitter) endangers young people and their emotional
well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content.
Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been
developed around the English language, and methods for detecting
Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language
cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the
effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language

BERT again. LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT demonstrated a 97% accuracy. Bi-LSTM
with FastText embedding word performed even better, achieving 98% accuracy. As

TL;DR: 提出TECA指标和CER机制来解决LLM在简单问题上过度思考的问题，通过动态确定最佳思考停止点来提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在复杂问题上表现出色，但在简单问题上会产生不必要的冗长推理步骤（过度思考），这降低了模型效率且难以根据问题复杂度调整推理深度。

Method: 引入Token熵累积平均（TECA）指标来衡量推理过程中的探索程度，提出"简要探索后决策"的推理范式，配合累积熵调节（CER）机制动态确定思考停止点。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，该方法显著减轻了过度思考问题而不牺牲解题能力，在简单数据集上平均响应长度减少高达71%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够创建更高效和自适应的推理过程，有效解决LLM的过度思考问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了InfoMosaic-Bench，这是首个专注于工具增强智能体中多源信息寻求的基准测试，覆盖六个代表性领域，要求智能体将通用搜索与领域特定工具相结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体严重依赖开放网络搜索，存在内容嘈杂不可靠、缺乏精确领域知识的问题。虽然MCP协议允许智能体访问数千种专业工具，但尚不清楚智能体是否能有效利用这些工具并与通用搜索结合解决复杂任务。

Method: 使用InfoMosaic-Flow可扩展流水线合成任务，将任务条件基于已验证的工具输出，强制执行跨源依赖关系，并过滤掉可通过简单查找解决的捷径案例。

Result: 对14个最先进LLM智能体的实验显示：仅靠网络信息不足（GPT-5准确率38.2%，通过率67.5%）；领域工具提供选择性但不一致的益处；22.4%的失败源于工具使用或选择错误。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在基本工具处理方面仍存在困难，需要开发能够有效整合多源信息的智能体系统。

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

TL;DR: 本文提出跨语言视角研究强化后训练推理能力的泛化，发现英语中心的大推理模型在其他语言上的推理能力转移存在显著差异，通过并行训练研究发现并行语言数量与跨语言推理转移遵循幂律关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注强化后训练推理能力在任务或模态间的泛化，本文创新性地从跨语言角度研究推理泛化，探讨英语强化后训练获得的推理能力是否能有效转移到其他语言。

Method: 系统评估英语中心大推理模型在多语言推理基准上的表现，引入量化跨语言可转移性的指标，通过干预研究分析模型依赖模式，并进行全面的并行训练研究。

Result: 发现跨语言可转移性因初始模型、目标语言和训练范式而异；强英语能力模型过度依赖英语特定模式导致跨语言泛化减弱；并行训练显示从单语到单并行语言存在性能跃升，跨语言推理转移与并行语言数量遵循幂律关系。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了大推理模型推理能力模拟人类认知的假设，为开发更语言无关的大推理模型提供了关键见解，揭示了英语中心模型未能完全跨语言泛化的问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

Abstract: We introduce VLM-Lens, a toolkit designed to enable systematic benchmarking,
analysis, and interpretation of vision-language models (VLMs) by supporting the
extraction of intermediate outputs from any layer during the forward pass of
open-source VLMs. VLM-Lens provides a unified, YAML-configurable interface that
abstracts away model-specific complexities and supports user-friendly operation
across diverse VLMs. It currently supports 16 state-of-the-art base VLMs and
their over 30 variants, and is extensible to accommodate new models without
changing the core logic.
  The toolkit integrates easily with various interpretability and analysis
methods. We demonstrate its usage with two simple analytical experiments,
revealing systematic differences in the hidden representations of VLMs across
layers and target concepts. VLM-Lens is released as an open-sourced project to
accelerate community efforts in understanding and improving VLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有顶级嵌入模型需要大量对比预训练、复杂训练流程和昂贵合成数据的问题，提供成本效益更高的替代方案。

Method: 直接从基础模型在600万个查询-文档-负样本元组上进行微调，这些数据来自开源非合成数据集。

Result: 在MTEB英语排行榜上，F2LLM-4B在约4B参数模型中排名第2，总体排名第7；F2LLM-1.7B在1B-2B规模模型中排名第1。

Conclusion: F2LLM为未来研究提供了强大、可复现且预算友好的基准，并开源了模型、训练数据和代码。

Abstract: We introduce F2LLM - Foundation to Feature Large Language Models, a suite of
state-of-the-art embedding models in three sizes: 0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B. Unlike
previous top-ranking embedding models that require massive contrastive
pretraining, sophisticated training pipelines, and costly synthetic training
data, F2LLM is directly finetuned from foundation models on 6 million
query-document-negative tuples curated from open-source, non-synthetic
datasets, striking a strong balance between training cost, model size, and
embedding performance. On the MTEB English leaderboard, F2LLM-4B ranks 2nd
among models with approximately 4B parameters and 7th overall, while F2LLM-1.7B
ranks 1st among models in the 1B-2B size range. To facilitate future research
in the field, we release the models, training dataset, and code, positioning
F2LLM as a strong, reproducible, and budget-friendly baseline for future works.

*Raphael Tang,Crystina Zhang,Wenyan Li,Carmen Lai,Pontus Stenetorp,Yao Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文质疑了在LLM竞技场评估中将平局视为模型实力相等的传统观点，提出平局更可能反映查询难度而非模型能力相当，并通过实验证明忽略平局时的评分更新能提高预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Elo评分系统将平局视为两个模型实力相等，但作者认为平局更可能源于查询难度（太容易或太客观），而非模型能力真正相当。

Method: 在三个真实世界竞技场数据集上，比较了四种评分系统在忽略平局评分更新时的表现，并分析了平局与查询特性的关联。

Result: 忽略平局评分更新可使战斗结果预测准确率相对提高1-3%；平局更常出现在非常容易和高度客观的查询中，风险比分别为1.37和1.35。

Conclusion: 建议未来评分系统重新考虑平局的语义定义，并在评分更新中考虑查询属性。

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.
