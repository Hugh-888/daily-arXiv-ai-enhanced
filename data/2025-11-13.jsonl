However, its performance is critically dependent on the selection of the circuit depth a parameter that must be specified a priori without clear guidance. In this paper, we introduce a variant of QAOA called dynamic depth Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (DDQAOA) that resolves the challenge of pre selecting a fixed circuit depth. Our method adaptively expands circuit depth, starting from p = 1 and progressing up to p = 10, by transferring learned parameters to deeper circuits based on convergence criteria. We tested this approach on 100 instances of the Constrained Shortest Path Problem (CSPP) at 10 qubit and 16 qubit scales. Our DDQAOA achieved superior approximation ratios and success probabilities with fewer CNOT gate evaluations than the standard QAOA for p = 3, 5, 10, and 15. In particular, while standard QAOA at p = 15 achieved results close to our approach, it used 217% and 159.3% more CNOT gates for 10 qubit and 16 qubit instances, respectively. This demonstrates the performance and practical applicability of DDQAOA to solve combinatorial optimization problems on near term devices."}

We benchmark our protocol by experimentally realizing out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a charge-transfer model at different temperatures.

We calculate the entanglement depth, corresponding to the size of the largest cluster of entangled qubits, finding that it scales as a power law with system size in both the phases. The power law exponent is 1 in the volume law phase ($p < p_c$) and continuously decreases to 0 as $p \\to 1$ in the area law phase. We explain this behavior by studying the spatial distribution of entangled clusters.

To address this, we develop a random Hamiltonian approach where the molecular $g$-tensor fluctuates due to classical lattice motion obtained from molecular dynamics simulations at constant temperature. Atomistic $g$-tensor fluctuations are used to construct Redfield quantum master equations that predict the relaxation $T_1$ and dephasing $T_2$ times of copper porphyrin qubits in a crystalline framework. Assuming one-phonon spin-lattice interaction processes, $1/T$ temperature scaling and $1/B^3$ magnetic field scaling of $T_1$ are established using atomistic bath correlation functions. Atomistic $T_1$ predictions overestimate the available experimental data by orders of magnitude. Quantitative agreement with measurements at all magnetic fields is restored by introducing a magnetic field noise model to describe lattice nuclear spins, with field-dependent noise amplitude in the range $δB\\sim 10\\,μ{\\rm T}- 1\\,{\\rm mT}$ for the copper porphyrin system. We show that while $T_1$ scales as $1/B$ experimentally due to a combination of spin-lattice and magnetic noise contributions, $T_2$ scales strictly as $ 1/B^2$ due to low-frequency dephasing processes associated with magnetic field noise.

CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality.

These systems possess long lived quasinormal modes with extremely small imaginary parts, originating from the effective cavity between the photon sphere and the object's interior. We show that the excitation of such modes is strongly suppressed, scaling with the imaginary part of their frequency, and therefore they contribute to the waveform only at very late times. This hierarchy naturally explains the structure of echo signals: the prompt ringdown is dominated by standard light ring modes, the early echoes arise from moderately damped cavity modes, and only the latest echoes are governed by long lived modes. Based on this, we propose a practical ringdown waveform model based on a superposition of ordinary black hole quasinormal modes and cavity modes, which captures the complexity of the ringdown of horizonless ultracompact objects. We further demonstrate that the combination of small excitation factors and weak damping enhances the robustness of long lived modes against localized perturbations, in contrast to the spectral instabilities affecting standard black hole quasinormal modes. Finally, we extend the analysis of greybody factors to exotic compact objects and wormholes, showing that they remain stable under small deformations of the effective potential and thus represent robust observables. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding excitation, stability, and echoes in ultracompact horizonless objects, with direct implications for their spectral properties and gravitational wave signatures."}

The defect is modeled by assigning complex-valued hopping amplitudes to the edges that connect the site corresponding to the mean position of the initial delocalized state to its nearest neighbors. We find that this single defective site is sufficient to enhance the ballistic spreading of an initially Gaussian wave packet. Extending these results, we implement a time-dependent alternation protocol between two distinct defect configurations, each individually yielding poor propagation of the state. The combination of these two unfavorable configurations improves the transport efficiency of the quantum walker, revealing a manifestation of Parrondo's paradox in CTQWs with delocalized initial states. This study provides new insights into the role of complex-phase defects and time-dependent protocols in CTQWs, demonstrating that the interplay between quantum interference and graph engineering can effectively enhance quantum transport in discrete lattices."}

The stochastic differential equations (SDEs) sample the positive P phase-space representation by analog complex-valued dynamical variables that are linked to the quantum operators. Statistical average over the stochastic trajectories yields the evolution of the quantum mechanical expectation values. However, numerical implementation of these SDEs for the TCM indicates divergent solutions, also known from other phase-space methods. This limits the applicability of the framework to finite propagation times, that are strongly dependent on the physical parameters and initial conditions of the system. We outline the underlying mathematical reason for these divergences and show that their contribution to the averages are, however, essential. To attempt to regularize the divergences, we transform the SDEs to an equivalent set of SDEs with different noise realisations, thereby pushing the valid time boundary. Quantum collapse and revival of the TCM, however, cannot be recovered by the stochastic trajectory approach, pointing to the general difficulty of the applicability of stochastic phase-space sampling methods to systems with strong quantum features."}

FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

Resource requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) are daunting, and hence, compilation techniques must be designed to ensure resource efficiency. There is a growing need for compilation strategies tailored to the early FTQC regime, which refers to the first generation of fault-tolerant machines operating under stringent resource constraints of fewer physical qubits and limited distillation capacity. Present-day compilation techniques are largely focused on overprovisioning of routing paths and make liberal assumptions regarding the availability of distillation factories. Our work develops compilation techniques that are tailored to the needs of early FTQC systems, including distillation-adaptive qubit layouts and routing techniques. In particular, we show that simple greedy heuristics are extremely effective for this problem, offering up to 60% reduction in the number of qubits compared to prior works. Our techniques offer results with an average overhead of 1.2X in execution time for a 53% reduction in qubits against the theoretical lower bounds. As the industry develops early FTQC systems with tens to hundreds of logical qubits over the coming years, our work has the potential to be widely useful for optimising program executions."}

On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games", "comment": "7 pages, 2 figures, v1 init", "summary": "In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

We consider a composite quantum system consisting of a principal system, heat bath, memory, and work source, and adopt an autonomous Hamiltonian framework. We derive constraints on the total Hamiltonian that ensure the work source to act as a catalyst preserving its original randomness, namely that the total unitary evolution must have a unitary partial transpose. We show that this requirement is equivalent to the commutativity of operators acting on the joint system of the principal system, bath, and memory, which underlies the Hamiltonian structure. Next, we generalize the quantum speed limit for the joint dynamics of system and memory to the quantum thermodynamic speed limit, from which we obtain a dynamical version of Landauer's bound.

However, conventional schemes that focus on directly using gravity to induce entanglement suffer from overwhelming environmental decoherence: maintaining entanglement between two oscillators requires an impractically high mechanical quality factor. In this work, we put forward an alternative reservoir-engineered scheme, whose core function is to quantify how gravity modifies (rather than prepares) the steady-state entanglement. Compared to quantum gravity, classical gravity introduces additional dissipative channels, which in turn give rise to distinct entanglement characteristics and thus enable the discrimination between the two types of gravity. Notably, this entanglement difference can still be maintained even when the mechanical quality factor is far below the threshold required by conventional schemes. Moreover, it demonstrates significant robustness against non-gravitational couplings, specifically, those like Casimir and Coulomb forces that are inherent in experimental setups. Our scheme relaxes the experimental requirements for verifying quantum gravity, thereby paving a new path toward its near-term realization."}

Quantum teleportation offers a \"disembodied\" way of transferring particles through a virtual channel--quantum entanglement--which, in principle, could overcome the photon transmission loss. Experimentally, however, no previous quantum teleportation of single photons has shown a higher survival probability than using direct transmission. To overcome this challenge, here we first propose and demonstrate an all-optical scheme for remote preparation of entangled photons. Through an effective 15-dB channel loss, we realize a heralding efficiency of 82% for event-ready entangled photons.

We analyzed the logarithmic negativity between two oscillators and investigate the effects of random force noise and linear damping.

Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function.

Motivated by this success, we consider an extended framework -- the hybrid metric-Palatini scalar-tensor (HMPST) theory -- in which an additional scalar field $φ$ modulates the curvature couplings, enriching the dynamics and enabling nontrivial self-interactions through scalar potentials. We focus on the analytically tractable linear-$f(\\hat{R})$ subclass and study its cosmological, strong-field, and weak-field regimes. In homogeneous and isotropic settings, we identify de Sitter and matter-dominated cosmological solutions describing accelerated expansion and early-universe behavior. For static, spherically symmetric configurations, the field equations yield analytic solutions generalizing the Janis-Newman-Winicour and Buchdahl metrics, including the Schwarzschild-de Sitter limit. In the weak-field regime, linearized perturbations around Minkowski space lead to Yukawa-type corrections to the gravitational potential, with an effective Newton constant $G_{\\rm eff}$ and post-Newtonian parameter $γ$ that recover General Relativity for heavy or weakly coupled scalars. These results show that the linear-$f(\\hat{R})$ HMPST subclass provides a consistent and unified description of gravity across cosmological, astrophysical, and Solar System scales, offering a fertile framework for connecting modified gravity to observations and effective field-theoretic extensions."}

We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency.

Half a century ago, the appearance of a moving emission source was addressed by Terrell and Penrose, who independently found that the aberration effect induces a conformal transformation on the observer's celestial sphere. Consequently, a snapshot of a moving sphere should remain circular. In this study, we examine the Terrell-Penrose effect with our ray-tracing simulations for two contrasting cases: i) static emission sources in the view of a moving observer, ii) and moving emission sources in the view of a static observer. In flat spacetime, it was believed that the images of the emission sources in these two cases are equivalent due to the relativity of motion. Our simulation demonstrates that although both cases remain apparent shape of the sphere, the apparent distortions of the images are different, and case ii) violates conformality on the observer's celestial sphere. Furthermore, we extended similar situations to a black hole spacetime. For case i), it is found that the conformal transformation induced by the aberration effect also holds in black hole spacetime, and is not restricted to observers in geodesic motion. For case ii), we study the slow-light effect on the moving sources, and show that the gravity introduces additional influence on the snapshots of a moving source."}

In this paper, we propose a novel method, \\emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance.

Here, we introduce a novel stealth beam steering method that is fundamentally immune to prediction. In a photon pair, the probe photon undergoes diffraction in an unpredictable direction at a grating due to wavelength randomness. The arrival time of the heralding photon, delayed by propagation through a dispersive medium, enables the determination of the probe photon's diffraction direction.

Using general relativistic radiative transfer, we compute synchrotron emission and polarization maps under different spins, MOG parameters, inclinations, and observing frequencies. In both models, the photon ring and central dark region expand with increasing $α$, whereas frame dragging produces pronounced brightness asymmetry. The BAAF model predicts a narrower bright ring and distinct polarization morphology near the event horizon. By introducing the net polarization angle $χ_{\\text{net}}$ and the second Fourier mode $\\angleβ_2$, we quantify inclination- and frame-dragging-induced polarization features.

While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures.

To illustrate this phenomenon, we use a Kerr parametric oscillator (KPO) with one- and two-photon drives that, despite the breaking of parity symmetry, may have doubly-degenerate levels. Different realizations of squeezed KPOs convey a great deal of attention, as effective Hamiltonians for driven superconducting circuits and the occurrence of degeneracy in such systems could be of practical interest in their application to obtain protected qubits in parity-breaking setups.

To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains.

As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models."}

In nanophotonics, a promising platform for quantum technologies, entanglement generation via plasmon-mediated coupling in quantum dot qubits is often modeled within the dipole limit, where only dipolar plasmons of the mediating nanoparticle are considered, and the local response approximation, where nonlocal corrections are ignored. However, multipolar effects manifest strongly at coupling distances less than the nanoparticle size, while nonlocal optical effects stem from a size-induced dielectric response. We investigated these two important effects in the generation of two-qubit entanglement mediated by plasmonic coupling. A cavity quantum electrodynamic approach is employed, where the induced plasmonic effects lead to modified transition rates in the dynamics of the coupled quantum dot qubits. We find that multipolar modes and size-dependent damping lead to entanglement decay at small coupling distances and limit mediated entanglement with certain particle sizes.

The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning.

Traditional mappings such as Jordan-Wigner or Bravyi-Kitaev often produce high-weight Pauli terms, increasing circuit depth and measurement complexity. Although several local qubit mappings have been proposed to address this challenge, most are specialized for structured models like the Hubbard Hamiltonian and perform poorly for realistic chemical systems with dense two-body interactions. In this work, we utilize a suite of techniques to construct compact and noise-resilient Fermion-to-qubit mappings suitable for general molecular Hamiltonians. Building on the Generalized Superfast Encoding (GSE) and other similar works, we demonstrate that it outperforms prior encodings in both accuracy and hardware efficiency for molecular simulations. Our improvements include path optimization within the Hamiltonian's interaction graph to minimize operator weight, introduction of multi-edge graph structures for enhanced error detection without added circuit depth, and a stabilizer measurement framework that directly maps logical terms and stabilizers to the Z-basis using Clifford simulation. Applying these methods to simulations of $(H_2)_2$ and $(H_2)_3$ systems yields significantly improved absolute and correlation energy estimates under realistic hardware noise, with further accuracy gains achieved by increasing code distance. We also propose a [[2N, N, 2]] variant of GSE compatible with square-lattice and (quasi-)linear hardware topologies, demonstrating a twofold reduction in RMSE for orbital rotations on IBM Kingston hardware.

Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty."}

These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation.

We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors.

VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case."}

However, due to the intrinsic complexity of quantum many-body systems, identifying a multipartite entanglement measure that is both efficiently computable and capable of accurately characterizing entanglement remains a challenging problem. To address these issues, we propose a family of two-parameter multipartite entanglement measures for mixed states, termed unified-entropy concentratable entanglements. Many well-known multipartite entanglement measures are recovered as special cases of this family of measures, such as the entanglement of formation and the concentratable entanglements introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 140501 (2021)]. We demonstrate that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements constitutes a well-defined entanglement monotones, and establish several desirable properties it satisfies, such as subadditivity and continuity. We further investigate the ordering relations of unified-entropy concentratable entanglements and discuss how these quantities can be efficiently estimated on near-term quantum devices. As an application, we demonstrate that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements can effectively distinguish between multi-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and W states. The ordering relations of these entanglement measures are further validated using four-partite star quantum network states and four-qubit Dicke states. Moreover, we find that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements exhibit greater sensitivity than the original concentratable entanglements in detecting certain four-partite star quantum network states."}

However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection. Across both language modeling and image classification tasks, SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption."}

This treatment can result in suboptimal decoding performance. In this work, we present a rigorous analytical framework to capture time-dependent Pauli noise, by exploiting the syndrome statistics of quantum error correction experiments. We propose a sliding-window estimation method which allows us to recover the frequency components of the noise, by using optimal window sizes that we derive analytically. We prove the noise-filtering behavior of sliding windows, linking window size to spectral cutoff frequencies, and provide an iterative algorithm that captures multiple drift frequencies. We further introduce an overlapping window algorithm that enables us to capture rapid multi-frequency noise drifts in a single-pass fashion. Simulations for both phenomenological and circuit-level noise models validate our framework, demonstrating robust tracking of multi-frequency drift. The logical error rate obtained from our estimated models consistently align with the ground-truth logical error rate, and we find suppression of logical errors compared to static error models.

This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method."}

As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs.

The separating classical oracle we construct is for a decision problem we coin spectral Forrelation -- the oracle describes two subsets of the boolean hypercube, and the computational task is to decide if there exists a quantum state whose standard basis measurement distribution is well supported on one subset while its Fourier basis measurement distribution is well supported on the other subset. This is equivalent to estimating the spectral norm of a \"Forrelation\" matrix between two sets that are accessible through membership queries.\n  Our lower bound derives from a simple observation that a query algorithm with a classical witness can be run multiple times to generate many samples from a distribution, while a quantum witness is a \"use once\" object. This observation allows us to reduce proving a QCMA lower bound to proving a sampling hardness result which does not simultaneously prove a QMA lower bound. To prove said sampling hardness result for QCMA, we observe that quantum access to the oracle can be compressed by expressing the problem in terms of bosons -- a novel \"second quantization\" perspective on compressed oracle techniques, which may be of independent interest. Using this compressed perspective on the sampling problem, we prove the sampling hardness result, completing the proof."}

For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \\(l_1\\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines."}

However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.\n  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization."}

In this work, we propose a scheme to amplify gravity-induced entanglement between two masses using parametric resonance. Specifically, we consider two parametrically resonant oscillators interacting through Newtonian gravity, each governed by the Mathieu equation. We analyzed the logarithmic negativity between two oscillators and investigate the effects of random force noise and linear damping.

We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size.

However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency."}

To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets."}

The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research."}

Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation.

Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size.

Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses."}

The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters."}

By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead.

This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency.

To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP.

Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\\%-3\\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer."}

In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM.

In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices.

This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples.

Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation.

To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD."}

Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction."}

This is a pre-print of an accepted paper at ICDMW: SABID 2025", "summary": "Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction."}

Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning."}

However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs."}

Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency."}

Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth."}

Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines."}

The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms."}

This approach leverages a delay accumulation mechanism to mitigate the costly arithmetic sums of classes and employs a Winner-Takes-All scheme to replace conventional magnitude comparators. Specifically, a Hamming distance-driven time-domain scheme is implemented for multi-class TMs. Furthermore, differential delay paths, combined with a leading-ones-detector logarithmic delay compression digital-time-domain scheme, are utilised for the coalesced TMs, accommodating both binary-signed and exponential-scale delay accumulation issues. Compared to the functionally equivalent, post-implementation digital TM architecture baseline, the proposed architecture demonstrates orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and throughput."}

Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths. Learning stability is maintained through in-loop chemical validity checks and an invalidity penalty, while large-scale training efficiency is restored \\textit{via} selective compilation, dataloader tuning, and gradient accumulation. In automated benchmarks, SiDGen generates ligands with high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, while achieving competitive performance in docking-based evaluations and maintaining reasonable molecular properties. These results demonstrate that SiDGen can deliver scalable, pocket-aware molecular design, providing a practical route to conditional generation for high-throughput drug discovery."}

We demonstrate that NSL-MT delivers improvements across all architectures: 3-12\\% BLEU gains for well-performing models and 56-89\\% gains for models lacking descent initial support. Furthermore, NSL-MT provides a 5x data efficiency multiplier -- training with 1,000 examples matches or exceeds normal training with 5,000 examples.

However, achieving this potential requires overcoming several fundamental challenges. One key limitation arises at the prediction stage, where the intrinsic randomness of quantum model outputs necessitates repeated executions, resulting in substantial overhead. To overcome this, we propose a novel measurement strategy for a variational quantum classifier that allows us to define the unambiguous quantum classifier. This strategy achieves near-deterministic predictions while maintaining competitive classification accuracy in noisy environments, all with significantly fewer quantum circuit executions. Although this approach entails a slight reduction in performance, it represents a favorable trade-off for improved resource efficiency. We further validate our theoretical model with supporting experimental results."}
